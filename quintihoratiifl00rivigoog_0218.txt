182 'HORATII FLACCI

Late conspicuum tollere verticem,
Maecenas, equitum decue.
Quanto quisque sibi plura negaverit,
Ab dis plura feret: nil cupientium
Nudus cestra peto et transfuga divitum
Partes linquere gestio,
contemptae dominus splendidior rei, 25
Quam ei quidquid erat impiger Apulus
Occultere meis dicerer hormie,
Magnas inter opes inope.
Puree rivus aquae silvaque jugerum
Paucorum et segetis certa fides meae so
Fulgentem imperio fertilis Africae
Fallit sorte beatior.
