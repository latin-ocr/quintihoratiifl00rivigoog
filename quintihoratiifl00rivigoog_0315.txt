EPODON LIBER, 3. 270

CARMEN ΙΙΙ.· ’

’ Between auc. 718-721.

Horace hera venta his wrath against some garliclr he had caten the day before at
Maecenaa' table, and which had diaagreed with him. He seems to implythet Maecenas
had played off a practical johe upon him, and the whole Epode is tull ol humour and
familiarity. This lenda to the supposition that it was not written very early iu their
acquaintance, while rrum the last two verses it has been juatly interred that it was
written before Maecenas was married to Terentia, or in loro with her, since tha notion
suggested by Acron (not aa his own however), that Terentia is there alluded to, is out
ot* the question. But, for reasons that will be stated iu Epod. xiv, Introduction, it ia
prohahle that Maecenas was married, or in lore with his future wife, in amc. 721. 'Ihis
ode was therefore written in all probability sometime between 718 and 721.
