CARMINUM IV. 12. 249

odes in honour of Drusus and 'liberius as the leading feature oi this book, and their
publication as the chief object of its publication, 1 can easily understand old composi·
tiens und new ones comparatirely indifferent being inserted to make up what aiter all
would be hut a mnall volume. 1 neither essent to nor differ from the dates given by
those who cssign an early period to the composition oi the ode; but 1 differ, as every
one must from Bentley, who assigna all the odes oi this book ιο a period long subse-
qnent ιο Vngil’s death, hut yet supposes him ιο be bere addressed. As Gemer says of
the great critic, “aua vineta caedit.” [Ritter also affirma that all the odes of this boolr
were written aster Yirgil’s death, and he consistently denies that the ode ia addreseed
to the poet Virgil] li any body were to affirm that no Virgil or invitation is really to
he found in the ode, and that itis a mere composition from the irnagination or the
Greek, Ishonld not quernei with him, onlyI should still believe that it was composed
before tha death of the poet, amo. 785, with Virgil's name added to give it a real
character.

The spring is come, the frost is ssed, the stream ilows gently‚ the swallow builds her

turned, lirgil. Bring me abor of nard and Iwill bring thee in return some genereus
Caleniun from Sulpicins' cellar. If my bargain please thee make haste, lay aeide
business and, remembering that thou must die, relax while thou mayst into folly for
atinae.
