196 HORATII FLACCI

Nec pestilentem sentiet Africum
Fecunda vitis neo sterilem seges
Robiginem eut dulces alumni
Pomifero grave tempus suno.
Nem quse nivali pascitur Algido

Aut crescit Albanis in herbis
Victima pontificum secures
Cervice tinget: te nihil attinet
Tentare mults caede bidentium
Parvos coronantem murino

Rore deos fragilique myrto
