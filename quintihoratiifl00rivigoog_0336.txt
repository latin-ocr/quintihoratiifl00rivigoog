300 HORA'PII FLACCI

GARMEN XI.

Supposing that Inachia (v. 6) were admitted to be the same as tbe Inachia of the
next ode (which is very doubtful, for the nume is fictitious, and the person is most
probably fictitious teo), we should bc at liberty ιο say that at least two years alapsed
between tbe composition of that ede and this 3 but as neither contains any certain evi·
denua cf its date, this comparison even then would be of no velue for detennining when
they were written. lhaulre compares Sat. ii. 8. 325, where Damasippus charges Horace
with “Mille puellarum, puerorum mille furores,” with bls own excuse ior writing so
little in this ode, “Amore, qni me praeter omnes expetit Mollibus in pueris autin puellis
urere’' (vv. 3, 4); and from this infers they were written about the same time. But
the Satire appears tc bave been written at the end of mmo. 7213 whereiore be infers
the Epode was written in that year; which however is not very convincing. 1 can see
nothing in the ode but a specimen of that species cf composition ιο which Horace first
betook himself in imitation of the Greek amatory writers. 'l'be metra is artificial and
difficolt of adaptation ιο ιιο Latin languere, and the last that sny writer in tbst lap·
gange would resort ιο for the expressiones passion, though in the Greelr it is very
expressive and teuder. 1 do not believe therefore that this ode can be identified with
any precise period of Horaee's life3 and to imagine him deeply in love with some young
Lyciscae is quite foreign tc the viewl take of Horace’s love poems. The name Lyciaeus
is probably formed from Lycus, Alcaeus’ fsvourite boy (0. i. 32. 11).

but my feet carried me still ιο her cruel door. Now Lyciscae has caught my beart.

deliver me, nor aught but some new ilame.
