148 HORATII FLACCI

ABGUMBNT.

Come down, Calliope, and sing a lotty strain. Is it adressa, or am 1 wandering iu the
Muses' grove? 1 was a child, and tired with playl lay 'down to sleep on the Apulian
hilis. Theredoves mademe a coveringof leaves, andi slept safe, and naen might
well wonder how the gods wore present with me. Yours arn 1, ys hluses, on the
Sabine hilis, at Tibur, st Praeneste, or at Baiae. Because 1 love your iountains and
your cheir 1 pes-iahed not when the battle was turned, nor by the accursed tree, nor '
in the Sieilian waters. Be ye with me and I will risit the mad Bosporus, the sanda
oi the Bast, the ravage Britan, the Censen, the Geloni, and the Tanais, unharmed.
Ye refresh linguatus when he brings back his weary troops stom the war. Mild are
your counsels, aud in peace is your delight. We know how that bold giant band
struck terror into the heart of J ove; but what was their strength againd the aegis
of Pallas? ''l'was that which drove them bacis, though Vulcan too, and J uno, and
Apollo with his bow, were there. Brute force falls selfdestroyedr the gods detest
violence, but tempered strength they promote: let Gyas be my witness, Orion the
seducor, Barth mourning for her sons, Aetna with ever-burning and uneonsuming
llarne, the vulture of Tityus, and the chains of Peirithous.

Seu fidibus citharaque Phoebi.

Auditis, an me ludit amabilis

Insania? Audire ct videor pios
Errare per lucos amoenae
Quos et aquae subcunt et aurae.
Me fabulosae Vulture in Apulo
Altrieis extra limen Apuliae
Ludo fatigatumque somno
Fronde nova puerum palumbes
