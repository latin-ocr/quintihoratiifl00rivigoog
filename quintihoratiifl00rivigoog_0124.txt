HORATII FLACCI‘

Insigne maestis praesidium reis
Et consulenti, Pollio, euriae,
Cui laurus aeternos honores
Delmatico peperit triumpho.
J am nunc minaei murmure cornuum
Perstringis aures, jam litui strepunt,
J em fulgor armorum fugaces
Terret equos equitumque voltus:
Audire magnos jam videor duces
Non indecere pulvere sordidos,
Et cuneta terrarum subacta
Praeter atrocem animum Catonis.
June ct deorum quisquis amicior
Afris inulta cesserat impetens
Tellure victorum nepotes
Rettulit inferias J ugurthae.
Quis non Latino sanguine pinguior
Campus sepulcris impia proelia
Testatur auditumque Medis
Hesperiae sonitum ruinae?
