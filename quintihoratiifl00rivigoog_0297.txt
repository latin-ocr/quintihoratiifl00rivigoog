Wnsr Augustus had completed 1111 period 01 ten years for which the imperial power

was 1111111 placed ln his hands (amo. 727-737), he determined to celebrate his suo-
ccss at home and abroad by an extraordinary festival, and he took as his model the
Ludi Tarentini or Taurii, which bad in former times bean observed aa a means 01 pro·
pitiating the infernal deitics, Die and Proserpina, 01 0οο11101101 great public 1111111·
ties. It does not appear that this festival ever was held at regular intervals. How
therefore the name Ludi Saeculares arose is not clear 1 but as it was now for 11111111 time
given, it was probably convenient to have it believed that the gemes were no 11011 than
the observanca 01 1 periodica] solemnity. 'l'he Quindecimviri ware ordered to consult
the Sibyllina books, and they reported, no doubt 11 they were 1111101, that the time was
come when this great national festival should be repeated, and the details of it were
laid down in a set of hexameter Greek verses, which have boen preserved by the histo·
1111 10111111, who gives a description of the festival (11.1). [Zosimus names the verses

abr Σιβύλλης χρησμόν 111 he says that they have been reported by others before ,

him] 1111111111 will be found at the end of the ode.

Since Dis and Proserpina ware tha divinities chiefly 11101111 11 the ancient gamos,
the question arisae, Why were Apollo and Diana the leading dsities on thie occasion?
If 11 ba admitted 11111 the festival was observed aa a matter 01 convenience and 101
from any religione feeling, it 11 101 difficolt 10 understand that 1111 older prmcdeuts
were only generally adopted, and tho deities most in fasbi'on were 11 a matter of course
substituted 101 the obsoleta Dis and Proserpina. Anguem considered himself especially
under the protection 01 Apollo, and the attributes assigned iu the olden time to 1111
insemel 1111111, as the originators and avertere 01 physical evils, had by this time been
transferred to Apollo and his sister as representing the sun and moon, as Mitscherlioh
has obserwed. Orelli on this point quotes with approval some remarks of J 11111 on Virg.

among the Etruscam aud 11011111, that the universe 1111 moving in a cycle 1111 com-
pletion 01 which would measure one grerw year 01 the world 5 that this year was divided
into teu months or ages (saecula), the length of which was 1011111111 but was declared
11011 time to time, as they ware completed, by prodigies sent from heaven. This
accounts 101 the irregular celebration 01 tha Saeculsr gemes 11 Rome. The Sibylline
books, baguas ontosay, declured which divinity especially prasided over each month3
Satum presided over the 11111111 Apollo the last, Diana over the last but one, as ’111111
civil year she claimed November as her own particular mouth. This is the reason why
these divinities were worshipped rather than others, because 01 the appearance 01 the
comet at the death of C. J ullus Caesar it was announced by 1111 soothsayer Volcatius
that the uinth (Diaua’e) mouth was passing away and the tenth was then beginning.
This account evidently has reference to the great Platonis year, which, when completa,
ia tobn'ng all the heaveuly bodies back to their original relative places. That the
