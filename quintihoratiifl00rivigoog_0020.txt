xvi PRBFACE.

Perhaps nearly all the learning that is necessary for the explanation
of the text has been collected¹; and future editors will do the best
service by applying to the interpretation of the text the knowledge
which their predecessore have transmitted.

Bentley often employed the method of interpretation to determine
the true reading, and he thought that the reason of the cassand
the matter (ratio et res ipsa) were sometimes stronger 'than a hun-
dred manuscripts, as he says in a note on O. iii. 27. In his note
on v. 5 of this Ode, he maintains that ‘rumpit’ for which there is
evidence, is better thau ‘rumpat' for which there is also evidence,
whether more or lees,I do not know. According to Bitter, the
evidence is for ‘rumpat’ 'l'his is just an instance which triesa
man’s power, if he will venture to give reasons, and I think that
Bentlcy'e argument is opposed by the ‘ratio et res ipsa! Bentley
says that ‘rumpat’ is quite contrary to that which precedes (ducat,
dcc), for it would be a lucky thing for the wicked to break off the
journey which they had began, a lucky thing to return home when
they have discovered that they are setting out inauspioiously. The
sense of the whole passage then, as he thinks, is this :-“ Iret
certain evil omens accompany the wicked. A serpent also is
wont to interrupt a journey which has been planned.’' This isa
very feeble addition to the first stanza; and if we take ‘rumpit’ as
Bentley does, it means that a serpent interrupte any person's jour·
ney, whether he is bad or good. But the subsequent words, ‘ ego
cni timeb0,’ arc addressed to Galatea, and all that precedes ought to
apply to the wicked; and Horace prays that bad luck may go with
them, when they do go, and ‚thata bad sign may break off a journey
which they have planned3 and this is the same as saying, may they
nothe ableto go where they intend to go. There is no centradic-
tion here. Itis not so easy to decide on the other passage (v. 15),
whether we should read ‘ vetet’ or ‘vetat’ Ritter has ‘ rumpat,’
‘ vetat :’ Keller has ‘ rumpit,’ ‘ vetet’ There is said to be only one · i

¹ Horace contains many words which have a technical meaning: they arc words oi
art. 'lhere is one which 1 intended to reticebat have omitted, theword‘l'orma'
(Epp. i. 16. 4), which, in the hnguags of the hgrimensorcs, isa plan oia pisce of land,
cut on bronze, and perhaps sometimes on other material.
