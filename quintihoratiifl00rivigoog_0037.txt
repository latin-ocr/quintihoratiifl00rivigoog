Wnsmn thie odeis un introduction to one hook or three is n question thet hes

bnt there is no internsl evidenoe to leod to thet conclusion. Bentley wne oi opinion
tint esch book wns produced seperately. lt is e grnceiol dedication to lieeoense oi ο
work, the composition of which hed occupied end emused the poet st intervnls ior some
years. It wne prohohly nt his petron's imtigntion thet he arranged his firgitive pisces
end pnt them forth in this collected form. There is e mixture of reel affection with
the nsunl dedicetory tlnttery in this ode, the leading iden of which, es in most cases,

doubt, in his memory Virgll’e linee (Georg. ii. 503, sqq.)= “sollicitent elii remis frete
