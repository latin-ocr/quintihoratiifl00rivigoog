SA'PIRARUM 1. 4. 361

undumeni.

(irent wus the liberty wherewith those worthies of the Old Comcdy set their mark upon
the vicious, eud thern Lucilius hes copied; s men of wit end perception, but u hsrsh
semifer ς osring less for the quelity of his verses then the quantity ς flull of words und
fulloffsults, which he was too lusy touvoid. As to your quantity,1 cure not for
thst ς end when Crispinus challenges me st great odds to try which of us cun write
quichest, 1 decline the invitation, und thnulr heaven thet 1 sm emen of quiet tem-
pcmment end few words. He mey go on pulling sud blowing like α pair of bellows,
but thet is notin my wey.

(v. 21.) fannius gete e testimonisl from his sdmirers, while no one will reed whstl
write (nnd 1 ern too nervom to recito it in public), because men do not like to heve
their fuults exposed, end there ure few who ere not open ιο hieme. Tulle any mun ·
οαι of s crowd, heis svericions, or ambitione, or lechemus, or he dotes upon fine plote
or fine stutues, or is running about, the world ιο melre his fortune. All such ere
efruid of verses lilre mine, end bete those who write them. “Tube cere of him ς he ,
isdengemus3 ull he cures for is ιο get up s isugh und suruse the old women und
children et the expenso of his friends.”

(v. 88.) Now let me say u word in reply. “ Ια ιιο first plsce I do not profess ιαιο c
poet. Sir feet in u verse which otherwise is mere prose, this does not muke e poet,
but genius, inspirstion, und sublime lenguege. And this hus led some to question
whether comedy is poctry, seeing thet ιιο lenguuge sud ideus ere ell those of corn·
mon life. There ure your fathers, for instance, seolding their sons, just ss you muy
hear every day, moreover γοα ιαογ shufile the words us γοα plesse iu true poetry
without eltering the sense, but that is not the cese with Lucilius’ lunguuge end mine
(you must rendit ss you would prose, or γοα melre nonsense of it).

(v. 63.) Βαι this question l msy discuss elsewhere. My present purpose is ιο show thet
γοα huvs no resson to be sfreid of this sort of writing. There ure your informers
who gonbout end ure the terror of ull rogues: the honest mun moy despice them.
But, even supposing you arethe rogue, 1 um no informer. 1 heve no desire ιο heve
my books thumbed ιγ ιιο vulger, or ιο read them to any but my friends, end thet
only when prust. 'lisere ere many 1 grant you who buwl their verses iu the forum
end in the public buthe, hut they ure mere blochheuds. “But we lrnow you loreto
οααογ, und do it with melicious intent.'' How cun γοα charge me with this? Nuy,
the men who slsnders his friend behind his book, οτ fuils to defend him from the
slrmder of others, who sime only αι being cslled e wit, who invente fulsehood und

’ ιιαια secrete, thut men is e soouurlrel ; let every honest citizen avoid him. 1 hsvs

’ often boen et tuble when one of the company hes emused himself with breaking his
wit upon the guests, not spering the host himself when be gets wurm3 now ,this mun
γοα Ιοοι upon us u funny fellow, while for my innocent satire 1 em called malignent,
ssrcustio, end so forth. When your friend Petillius is mentioned you defend him
efter your own fushion, thetis, γοα dumn him with s sneer, the veriest poison, which
shull never ιο found, if 1 lrnow myself st sll, in sny thing 1 msy write.

(v. 10³.) ΙΙ 1 heve spokenslittletoo freely of etherei meybepsrdoned on this ground: ,
my excellent father ulwuys tsught me ιγ exuurples. If he would heve me live fru-
gslly, he would ssy, “ Loolr ut the miscry ιο which our friend Albius’ son eud Burrus
heve reduced themselves ιγ their extravegnnce.'' When he would keep me from bed
women, “Tske Scetnnius for s wurniug.'’ “See whst scendel uttuches ιο Ιιοιοαίαο.”
“ Wsser men moy touch γοα ιγ precept end theory: my cure shall be ιο wetch over
your practice till you ere able to tuke cere of yourself.'' ΙΙ ho would hove me do
something thet was right, he would tuke onc of the judicos und suy, “There is sn
exemplo for you.'' On tho other hund, if hc would prevent me from doing something
