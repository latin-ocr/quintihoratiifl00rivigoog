viii PREFACE.

’ though sometimes they are not supported by any that are known
. now.

The editions that I hare consulted Ι will not tire tlre reader by
enumerating. No classical author has been edited and commented
upon so often as Horace. 'Phe editions Ihave always referred to
when a difficulty of interpretation occurred are those of Ascensius
(1519), with the scholia of Acron and Porphyrion, Lambinus,
Oruquius (for his commentator), Torrentius, Gesner, Doering, Dil-
lenburger, and Orelli. From these I have got real help, especially
from Torrentius, whose commentary is in general clear, learned, and
judicious. Ι have often referred to the French editors Sanadon and
Dacier, but their judgment is not to be trusted. The old edition of
Landini, published at Florence in 1482, and reprintcd at Venice the
next year, is in my possession, and will be found frequently referred

edited the Odes, butaro so redundant in quotation and admiring

His notes on law-terma are valuable, but in such matters Ι have
been chiefly indebted to the judgment of my friend and coadjutor

Mr. Long, whose advice I have lilrewise followed in many other

I have not entered at any length upon the chronology of Horaoe's
poema. I hare referred to the subject in the Introduction, and

have done my best to determine the date of each poem sofar as ·

there are reasonable grounds to argue upon. The principal autho-
rities on this subject now relied upon and referred to in this book
are Franks (Fasti Horatiani, Berlin, 1839) and Kirchner (Quaes-
tiones Horatianae, Leipzig, 1834). These two writers differ mate-
rially from one another, and both of them from Bentley, who in his
