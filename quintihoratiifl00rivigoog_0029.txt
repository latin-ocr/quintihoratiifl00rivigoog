coast of Italy. When this happened nobody kuows. After the publiea·
tion of the three books of odes, Horace seeum to have oeased from that
style of writing, or nearly so; and the only other compositione we know
of his having produced in the next few years are metrieal Epistles ιο
different friends, of which he published a volume probably in arae. 734
or 735. He seems ιο have taken up the study of the Greek philoso-
phical writers, and to have got a good deal interested in them, and also
to have become a little tired of the world and diegusted with the
jealousies his reputation created His health did not improve as he got
older, aud he put himself under the care of Antonius Musa, the em·
peror's new physician⁸. By his educe he gave up, for a time at least,
his favourite Baiae. But he found it necessary ιο bea good deal away
bom Rome, especially in the autumn and winter⁴. ¹ ³
In mue. 737 Augustus celebrated the Ludi Saeculares, and Horace
was required ιο write au Ode for the oeoasion, which he did, aud it has
been preserved. This circumstance, aud the credit it brought him, may
have given his mind another leauing ιο Ode-writing, and have helped
him to produce the fourth book, a few pieoes in which may have been
written at any time. It is said that Augustus particularly desired
lloraoe ιο publish another book of Odes, in order that those he wrote
upon the victorias of Drusus and Tiberius (4 and 14) might appear in
it. The latter of these Odes was not written, I believe, till auc. 741,
when Augustus returned from Gaul. If so, the book was probably
published in that year, when Horace was fifty-two. Tho Odes of the
fourth book show no diminution of power, but the reverse. There are
none in the first three books that surpass or perhaps equal the Ode
in honour of Drusus, and few superior ιο that which is addressed to
Lollius. The success of the first three books, aud the honour of being
chosen to oompose the' Ode at the Ludi Saeculares, seem ιο have giren
him encouragement. There are no incidente in his life during the above
period recorded or alluded ιο iu his poems. He lived five years after
the publication of the fourth book of Odes, if the above date be correct,
aud during that time I think it probable he wrote the Epistles ιο Au·
gustus and Florus which form the second book ; and having conceived
the intention of writing a poem on the ert and progress of poetry, he
wrote as much of it as appears in the Epistle to the Pisones which has
been preserved among his werke. The fragments of which that poem
appears to be composed, aud which some have vainly tried ιο reduce ιο

a consistent whole, may have been written earlier than I have supposed ; Ι

but there is so much affinity between the Ars Poetica and the Epistle
to Augustus that 1 believe they were written ot no great interval of
