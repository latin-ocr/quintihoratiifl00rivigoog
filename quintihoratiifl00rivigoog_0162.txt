lae HORATII FLACCI

Consentit astrum. 'Pe Jovis impio
'Ihtela Saturno refulgens
Eripuit volucrisque Fati
Tardavit alas, cum populus frequens 25
Laetum theatris ter crepuit sonum:
Me truncus illapsus cerebro
Sustulerat, nisi Faunus ictum
Dextra levasset, Mercurialium
Custos virorum. Reddere victimas so
Aedemque votivam memento:
Nos humilem feriemus agnam.
