GARMEN XI.

'l'hs sammon inscription An Mrnnnmnn, adopted by Bentley end others, is plainly
wrong, und calculated to mislead. 'l'he inscription should he n> neronum, ii unp
thing 3 for hlereury dissppears after the first two verses. The miracles alluded to,
except Amphiou’n, were those of Orpheus, aud of the lyre in hie hands, not Mereury's,
which Orelli not psroeiving eontradiots himself. 'lhe ode is of the same eluse us the
two last. We hare uo means of traeing the original ir it isa oopy, sud there is no

ARGUMENT.

hlereury, who didst teach Amphion to move stores, and thou, lyra, onoe dumb‚ now wel-
eome at least and festival, tune me a strsin to which even Lyde, though she be ireo

bloody sentinet and Ixion, and Tityus, ond the daughters ol Dnnst. Lot Lyde henr
ol their crime and punishment, and how one wns meroiiul aud spared her young
husband’s life, myinffi ‘⁴ Rise up3 begone, lest the sleep of death overtake thee. They
have sprung upon their prey. My henrt is not as their heart. lwill do thee no
harm. net my father do with me ss hs will, yet go thou while night end love protect
thee. Furewell, and when 1 am gone engrnve a word oi sorrow ou my tomb.’'

Ducere et rivos celeres morari3
