CARMINUM III. 2.

Virtus repulsae nescia sordidae
Inteminatis fulget honoribus,
Nec sumit aut ponit secures -
Arbitrio popularis aurae.
Virtus recludens immeritis mori
Caelum negata tentat iter via,
Coetusque volgares et udam
Spernit humum firgiente penna.
Est et fideli tuta silentio

Merces: vetabo qui Cereris sacrum
Vulgarit arcanae sub isdem
Sit trabibus fragilemve meeum
