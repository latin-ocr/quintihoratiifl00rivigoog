EPISTLE XII.
nuo. 734.

locius, ιο whom this Epistle is addressed, has boen mentioued, with all that is known
of him, lu the Introduction to C. i. 29, aad Pompeius Grosphus in C. ii. 16. Ιι is a
letter of introduction for Grosphus to Iccius, who ιιι employed in mausging Agripps’s
estates in Sicily.

Ιι is possible Horace msy bave bada letter from Iccius in which he wrote something
that gave riso ιο ιιι reflections with which the Epistle begins ς ιιι ιο affirm fr0m what
Horace bere says that Iccius was a miser or a misanthrope, or any thing else but a gaad

Use what yon get vaith discr-ation, Iccius, ιιι ιο man ιιι be better off ιιιι you. Be

content. He is ιοι poor who has enough. As long aa you hare good benith the r

riches ol hings could add nothing to your happiness. Aocnstom yourself to simple
fare and you will never leave it οι, though you should be turned into gold, whether
it be that money makes no change in our naturas, or because, like a wisc man, you
count every thing less thau virtue. We rnsy wonder why Democritus should hare

But be all this as it may, l beg you to receive Pompeius Grosphus, and whatever be
