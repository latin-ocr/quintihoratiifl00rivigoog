lARMEN XIX.

This ode was perhaps composed at the time of the Liberalia, like the third elegy oftha
tiibh book of Ovid's Tristia, but in what year there are no means of determining. Orelli
says it appears ιο be copied from a Greek poem, bacam it approaehea the character of
the dithyramb. Except in the subject the resemblance does not striks me. lf Horace
had written on purpose ιο show the impossibility of reaching the force and beauty of the
higher order of Greek lyric poetry through tho medium of his language, he could not
have snccesdod better, and the ἐνθουσιασμός, ·ι“ιιιοι·,’ ke.. which some commentatore
profess ιο find in the ode, exist, 1 think, only in their own mistaten conception of
Horace's mind and writings. They create the inspiratiou they expect to find. Τιο
subject is as likely to hare been suggested bya Greek picture aa a Greek poem, but
neither hypothesis is necessary. The scene is laid in the woods,

ir* t βακχιῶται
tel Διόνυσος ἐμβατεύει
θείαις marronae eretum (Soph. Oed. Col. 678 ⁸ka
and the poet is supposed to come suddenly upon the party, consisting of Bacchus, with
his attendant nymphe, and the wild creaturas of tho woods, all attending with admiration
to the god as hs singu hia own achierements. The poet is amitten with terror, which
gives place ιο the inspiration ofthe divinity, iu virtue of which he breaks out into achaea
of all he had heard. Ι cannot persuade myaelf that in this style Horace felt that hia
strength lay, or that he made any pratension to the afflatus which his admirers claim
for him. There is akill in the poem ς hut the Greek tireis wanting, as we may easily
conceive would he the case with a gentlernan farming his own astate on tha Sabine billa.
