'l'he length oi this odeis more imposing then the subject, which sppesre ιο ιι ι jour·

which story occupies two-thirsis ol the ode, ιιι ιιιιιιιι Gulutce ιιι ιιι joumey from

the editors. 'l'he length oi the digression is simply ι way with Ηοιιιι (ιι in the story
of Regulus, C. iii. 5, ιιι of Hypermnestru, iii. 11), ιιι Ρὶιιιι toolr the ιιιιι liberty

iecsing to ιι ιι imitation of this author, ιιι little but his rhythm ιιι ι few of his
phrases to sustsin the resemblance. [Ritter's remsrlr on the ledy is s good specimen
ol hie manner of interpretation. Ii it does not instruct, it msy ιιιιιιι. “ Geletes ι
