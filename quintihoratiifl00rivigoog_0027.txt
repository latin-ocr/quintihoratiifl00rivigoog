Itis evident that Maecenas valued his society and understood his
character.

At his house, probably, Horace became intimate with Pollio and the
many persons 01 consideration whose friendship he appears 10 have
enjoyed. Thrcugh Maecenas 0100 1110 probable Horace was introduced
to Augustus, but when that happened isunoertain. In 0100. 717
Maecenas was deputed by Augustus to meet M. Antonius at Brundi·
11010, and he took Horace with him 00 that journey, 011111101100 amusing
account is given in the 111111 Satira 01 the first book. Horace appears
te have parted from 1110 1001 01 1110 company at Brundisium, and per·
haps returned to Rome by Tarentum and Venusia. (See 010100).
Between 11110 journey and 0100. 722 Horace received from his friend
the present 01 0 small estate in 1110 valley 01 1110 Digentia (Licenza),
situated about thirty-four miles 11001 110100, and 10011000 11010 Tibur, in
the Sabine country. 0111110 property he gives adescription in his Epistle
10 Quintius (i. 16), and he appears to have lived there a part 01 every year,
and to have been fond 011110 01000, which was very quiet and retirad, being
four miles from the nearest town, Varia' (Vico Varo), the 000110 01 1110
district, hut 01 00 great importante. During this interval he con·
tinued to write Satires and Epodes, but 0100, 11 appears 10 010 0101101110,
00100 01 the Odes, which 00100 years laterbe published, and otherswhich
be did 001 001111011. These compositione I have no doubt were 0000 by
his friends, and were pretty well known before any 01 them were collected

supposes the first book was published. It may 11010 been οο, but
Franke's arguments 010 001 conclusive. In auc. 723 the battle 01
Actium was fought, and in the prospect 01 Maecenas having 0 command
ou that occasion, Horace wrote him a touching poem, which stands first

in the book 01 Epodes. The ninth Epcde was written immediately
01101 the victory, and 111010 10 no 00001 10 the book 01 Epodes which
need be placed later. Iagree therefore with Franks 10 thinking that'
book, 01 which 000 01 two 000010 010 among Horace’s earliest composi·
tione, may have been published 10 auc· 724. In that year was written,
