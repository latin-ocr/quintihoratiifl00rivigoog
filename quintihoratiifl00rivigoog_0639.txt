EPISTOLARUM Ι. ll. 603

EPISTLE XI.

‘l'his Epistle is addressed to one Bullatius, of whom wa know nothing. He was
travelling in the Aegean and in Asia Minor, and was absent longer than Horace
wished, or thought good for him, and the object of this letter is to induce him
to return. The commentatore generally have α very mean opinion of Bullatius,
who has suffered et their hands hurder measure than ααγ of Horace's hiends.
But his chief vice seems to have been a fondness for travelling, and an especial
admiration of some of the finest and most ancient towns in the world. lf we ara
to add to this that for soma reason or other he was unhappy, and expected to
relieve himself by change of soene, he may have been misteken in his means, but
if so, plenty of people heve shared in his mistake‚ and when Horace puta before
Bullatius as the ond of life the enjoyment of the present moment-a doctrine he
seems to have held pretty strongly,-we may doubt whether his philosophy is not
at least as bad es his friend’s practice. But we need not assume any thing injurious
to Bullatiua Such reflections upon travel as occur in this Epistlo might naturally
hove suggested themselves whomsoever it had been written to. We must not judgo
Horaca's Epistles aa we would private letters, meant only for the reading of the
persons they are written to.

We have no means oi knowing when the Epistle was written.

ARGUMENT.

What think γοα, Bullatius, of the line pisces of the uase? are they not all tame
compared with οαι· Campus and Tiberi Have γοα set your beart upon one of
Attalus’ towns, or are you so tired of travelling that γοα must settle down at
Lebedus, the dullest oi places, aa γοα lrnowi And yet 1 could live there will·
ingly, l consess, forgetting home and every body, to loolr out upon the stormy sea.
But -tlre traveller who turns in to hia tavern to rest would not stay there for ever γ
and he who warms himself hythe tire or a hot bath does not make these the end
of his lile. So if γοα have been tempesttost, and have been glad to put into port,
is that ααγ reason why γοα should sell γοαι· ship and never come back? 'lhose
parts are very well for siclr people, hut αα long as health and fortune let you be at
Rome, stay hele and praise Samos anrl the rest at α distance. Be thonlrful for the
blessings of the day, aud live for the present honr ς so will γοα he happy whatever
place γοα may be in. 'Tis reason that takes away sorrow, and we only change our
olime when we shift our place. It is but a busy idlencss that employa us when we
seelr happiness in ships and in couches. All γοα want is here or at dull Ulubrae, if
your heart be true and fail γοα not.
