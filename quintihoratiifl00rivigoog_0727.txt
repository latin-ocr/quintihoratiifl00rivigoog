EPISTOLARUM II. 2. 691

Levabit cultu, virtute carentia tollet,

Ludentis speciem dabit et torquebitur, ut qui
Nune Satyrum, nunc agrestem Cyclopa movetur.
Praetulerim scriptor delirus inersque videri,
Dum mea delectent mala me vel deniqne fallant,

Quam sapere et ringi. Fuit haud ignobilis Argis,
. Qui se eradebat miros audire tragoedos,

ln vacuo laetus sessor plausorque theatro 3
Caetera qui vitae servaret munia recto

More, bonus sane vicinus, amabilis hospes,
Cernis in uxorem, posset qui ignoscere servis
Et signo laeso non insanire lagenae,

Posset qui rupem et putenm vitarepatentem.
Hie ubi cognatorum opibus curisque refectus
Expulit elleboro morbum bilemque meraco
Et redit ad sese: “ Pol me occidistis, amici,
Non servastis,'' ait, “ eni sic extorta voluptas
Et demptus per vim mentis gratissimus error.”
Nimirum sapere est abjectis utile nugis,

Iit tempestivum pueris concedere ludum3
