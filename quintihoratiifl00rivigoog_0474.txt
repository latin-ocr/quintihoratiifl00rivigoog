from which Trebatius quotes sud not from sny in the second book, from which he

Some meu think my satire too severe, others think it wnnts power. Tell mc, Trebatius,
whst sm I to do?

Kesp quiet.

What, not write st ulli

'l'hct is my advice.

Well certainly it would be better ς but Ι een get no rest.

'l'heu go sucl swlm the hiber, or drink freely over-night ς or, if you must write, write ol'

Good father, I heve no strength for thot: the bettio-field isnot s iit theme ior every

But you moy write of his virtues sud his fortitude, ss Lucilius wrote oi Sm'pio’s.

So l will when opportunity offers. But Csescr is only to be opprosched st the proper

Why, were Laelius end Scipio offended with Lucilius when hs smcked all the guest

No, Ι do not. But Ι must remind you thetis any men· write scurrilous verses against
