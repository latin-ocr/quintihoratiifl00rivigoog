SATIRE ΙΠ.

Horace eppeers to heve brought enemies upon himself hythe lust Satine, und perhaps
by others, which bevenot besu published. His emiuble temper wus not very well queli-
iled for thot sort of writing, sud we may infer frum the present poem thet he wished
tc clesr himself from the imputetion of a censorious spirit, und su to set himself right
with Mseoenss und his friends. The connexion between the two Satires is secu in the
opening of this, iu which Tigellius is agsin introduced sud tbe peculiaritim of his che·
ructes described, for no other resson, ss it would seem, but to serve ss s text for the dis·
course thet follows, on the duty of judging others cheritsbly ss we wish te be judged
ourselves. In the course of his remarks on this subject Horace comes ucross two of the
Stoic absurdities: one thet cll feults sre ulike (v. 96 sqq), which he meets by the
doctrine thet expediency is elmost the mother of justice end eqnity; end the other
thet every wise mun (thst is, every Stolo) is endowed with ull the gists of ert snd
fortune from the skill of the mechunic to the power of u king. with s jeet upon this
folly the Setire eloses.

The character of Tigellius is hsppily described (“ Not oue, but ull mnnkiud's epi·
tome ’'), sud s tuneof good feeling runs throughout the Sutire. the lengusge is genisl,
und the sentiments umisble. 'l'he style is Horscefs own, us we muy suppose. 'lhet of
Lucilius, it is olens, was more efter the fushion of the second Setire, in which his
freedom of speech sud lieentious lungusge sppesr to me to be simod st without the
power which he possessed of giving them point end severity. No one who resds this
Sutire would wish to see llorscc iu the disguise of the other.

If there is between the tw0 the connexion ubove supposed, the third Setire must huwe
been written et uo grest distuuee of time efter the other. But it uppeurs from v. 63
thet he wes now well acquaintsd with Maecenas, though not on the terme of intimacy
which nilerwsrds grew up between them. On these mouuds it seems probsble that
the Sstire wss written about the eud of mue. 716, es Kirchner supposes.

ARGUMENT.

Singers heve ull one hut—that they will never sing to their friends when they ere
asked, und never leswe oh* when they ere not. 'l'his werthe osse with ligellius, the
most inconsistent mun in the world. Csessr himself could not induce him to sing
unless he chose ς when the fit wse on him he would keep it up from the first course
to the dssscrt ; one moment in e hurry, another shsurdly slow; now with 200 slnvoe,
now with but ten 3 one while talking big, another sll humility; one while content
with u little, another squuudering milliens; up sll night, snoring ull day.

But what, heve you no fuultsf Yes, but perhaps not so bed ss his. And yet 1 sm
not like Maenius, who, while he exposed his neighbour's feults, coolly declared he
msde excuses for his own. Why should u mun be blind to his own defects und heve
sn esgle’s eye for his follows' f He mey presently find them turning the tnbles upon
him. Your friend we will my is u little hssty, sud sensitive, sud perhaps not very
polished ς but he is s good mun, sud kind to you, end o men of genius withsl. In
short, examine yourself, sud see whst feults nature or neglect hes sown in your own
bresst before you pass judgmcnt on others.

het us think of this, how the lovon overlooks or even loves the dcforrnities of his mis·
tress. Solet ns err in friendship snd not be teo festidious3 even ss the fond fsthcr
finds pretty names for his ugly boy's defectu. Let the close be eslled thrifty ; the silly
men whois u little too prone to boest, eey he is anxious to plesse t the rude eud ofl'·
