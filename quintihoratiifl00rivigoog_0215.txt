CARMINUM III. 15. 179

naumann

Put a stopto thy iatriguec; for thou art old and poor, a cloud among bright stara, ready
to drop into thy grave. What becometh thy daughter becometh aot thee, Chloris.
She may go aud besiege the young mcu's dooraz she is in lore and auunot help it.
But do thou go apin ς music and flowers and wine ara not for thes.

Uxoa pauperis Ibyci,
Tandem nequitiae fige modum tuae
Famosisque laboribus:
Maturo propior desine funeri
Inter ludere virgines
Et stellis nebulam spargere candidis.
Non siquid Pholoiin satis
Et te, Chlori, decet: filia rectius
Expugnat juvenum domos,
Pulso Thyias uti concita tympano. 10
Illum cogit amor Nothi
Lascivae similem ludere capreae:
Te lanae prope nobilem
'Ponsae Luceriam, non citharae decent,
Nec flos purpureus rosae 15

Noc poti vetulam faece tenus cadi.
