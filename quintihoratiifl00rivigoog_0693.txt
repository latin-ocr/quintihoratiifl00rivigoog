, Romulus et Liber pater et eum Castore Pollux, 5
Post ingentia facta deorum in templa recepti, ·
Dum terras hominumque colunt genus, aspera bella
Componunt, agros assignant, oppida condunt,

Speratum meritis, Diram qui contudit hydram
Notaque fatali portenta labore subegit,
Comperit invidiam supremo fine domari.
Urit enim fulgore suo qui praegravat artes
Infra ee positas3 exstinctus amabitur idem.
Praesenti tibi maturos largimur honores,¹ 15
