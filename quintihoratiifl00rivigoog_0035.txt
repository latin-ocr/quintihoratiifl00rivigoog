INTRODUOTION. xxxi

O. i. 6.—This metre consiste of three Asclepiadem verses, euch as
Ο. 1, and a Glyconean, aa in Ο. 3. 1110. i. 15. 1411136 1 trocheo
occurs in the first foot (see note). The other Odes are i. 24, 333 ii. 123
iii. 10, 163 iv.5, 12.

C. i. 7.-This measure takes its name from Alcman, the lyric poet
of Sparta. It consiste of two verses, of which the first is a complete
hexameter, and the second 11 made up of the four last feet of an
hexameter. To this belong Ο. 1. 28, and Epod. xii.

C. i. 8.-There is no other Ode in thie metro, which also consiste of
two verses. Τ111 first consiste of a dectyl and two trochees‚ or a trocheo
and spondeo, ,, u υ J ,, υ Ι ,, 0. This takes ite name from Aristo-
phanes. The second isa verse, of which the first half consiste of two
trochees anda dactyl, with along syllable added, and the second half
ie the first reversed, thus:

,claimant-wasme

Horace always hae a spondee in the second place.

' O. i. 9.—This is the ordinary Α10110 metre, in which each stanna
consiste of four verses. The first two are divided thus:

zi-oi-ui-uui-cv

though Horace usually substitutee a spondeo for the second trochee,
the only exception being iii. 5. 17. The caesura usually falle after the
fitth syllable, 10 which rnle exceptione ¹will be found in C. i. 16. 21, 371
5, 14; ii. 17. 21 ς iv. 14. 17. This caesura the Greeks did notobeerve.
The first syllable of the verse is more commonly long than short. It
11 usual to look upon the first part of the verse as iambic, and 10 divide
it thus:

Ξ-Ιυ-Ι-Ι·

BntI baveno doubt it is trochaic. The third verse is 1110 11001110,

” consisting of a syllable (usually¹ long) followed by four trocheus, a

spondes being substituted by Horace for the second trochee. The
fourth verse consiste of two dactyle aad two trochees.

C. i. 11.-This is an Asclepiadean metre, rather peculiar. The
division to which we are gnided by the ear seems to separate each
verse into three parts, as follows:

--Ι-υυΙ-1Ι-υυΙ-ΙΙ-υυΙ-υυ
This classes it with the dcwdpnyrot. Those who resort to the division

by choriambi deetroy the natural rhythm. To this belong i. 18;
iv.10.
