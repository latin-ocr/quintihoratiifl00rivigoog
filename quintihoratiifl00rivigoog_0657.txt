srisrohnRUM I. 15.

Rure meo possum quidvis perferre patique,

Ad mare cum veni generosum et lene requiro,
Quod curas abigat, quod cum spe divite manet

In venas animumque meum, quod verba ministret,
Quod me Lucanae juvenem commendet amicae.)

Utra magis pisces et echinos aequora celent,

Fortiter absumptis urbanus coepit haberi,

impransus non qui civem dinosceret hoste,
Quaelibet in quemvis opprobria fingere saevus,
Pernicies et tempestas barathrumque macelli,
Quidquid quaesierat ventri donabat avaro.
