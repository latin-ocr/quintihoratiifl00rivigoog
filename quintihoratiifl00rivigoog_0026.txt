twenty, it was in nuo. 709, the year before Ο. Julius Caesar was assas·
sinated. After· that event Brutus and Cassius left Rome and went to
Graece. Foresoeing the struggle that was before them, they got round
them many of the young men ιιι that time stndying at Athens, and
Horace was appointed a tribune' in Brutus’ army, ιι high command, for
which he was not qualified. He went with Brutus into Asia Minor,
and finally shared his defeat at Philippi, amc. 712. He makes humorous
allusion to this defeat in his Ode to Pompeius Varus (ii. 7). After the
battle he came to Italy, having obtained permission to do so, like many
others who were willing to give up ιι desperate cause and settle quietly
ethome. His patrimouy⁸‚ however, was forfeited, and he seems ιο
have had no means of subsistence, which induced him to employ himself
in writing verses, with the view perhaps of bringing himself into notiee⁹
rather than for the purpose of making money by their sala. It is not
impossible, however, that some of his earliest compositione were severe
personal satiras and lampoons, written at the instigation of those who
were able to pay him for them. That the book of Epodes which we
possess does not contain all that he wrote in Archilochus' vein, I think
is pretty certain3 and the same 1 believe may be said of the books of
Satires. Probably his earliest efforts were more severe aud licentious
than those which his judgment allowed him afterwards to publish‚
though some of these archad enough. With Archilochus and Lucilius
before him as models, and without the experiente hc afterwards gained,
his earliest productione may without difficulty be supposed to have been
such as in later life he would condemn By some means he managed
to get a place as scriba¹ in the Quaestor's office, whether by purchase
or interest does not appear. In either case we must suppose he con·
trived soon ιο make friends, though he could not do so by the course
he pursued without also making many enemies. His Satires are fnll of
allusione ιο the eumity his verses had raised up for him on all hands.
He became acquainted‚ among other literary persons, with Virgil and
Varius, who about three years after his return (amc. 715) introduced
him to Maecenas, who was caroful of receiving into his circle Brutus’
tribune, and one whose writings were of a kind that was new and un·
popular. He accordingly saw nothing of Horace for nine months after
his introduction (S. i. 6. 61). He then sent for him (aue. 716), and from
that time continued ιο be his patron and friend. There is nothing

⁹ Kirchner (Qu. Hor. p. 15, n. 4) and Franks (sat. Hor. p. 20) reject this notiou,
supposing Horace to mean in tha passage on which it isfounded (Epp. ii. 2. mathat
poverty mado him desperato aud careless of consequentes, but that when he besano

comparatively rich he lost that stimulus.
