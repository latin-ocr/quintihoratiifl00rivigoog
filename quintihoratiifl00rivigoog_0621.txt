EPISTLH VII.

On some occasion Horace haring gone into the country for change oi air on account
oi his beelth, at the beginning of August, was tempted ιο stay away the whole month3
and es he had promised Maecenas ιο neten-n in a few days, he had perhaps received a
letter from hia friend reminding him of that promise, and begging him to come back.
Maecenas was a valetudinarian, and had probably acme of the querulosa selflshness
that usually attende on that condition. we may inter aa much from that oda (ii. 17),
which begins ‘¹ Cur me querelis exanimas tuis l'’ and he very likely leit the want of
Horace’s society at this time. We can only guther the tone of his letter or mesoaga
from the character of Horace'a reply. He says he has no roind ιο rislo a return οι his
aiolneas by going bach during the autumn to Rome; indeed thot he meant ιο ιο
absent st some warm place on the coast through the winton that he was no longer
aa young and chaerinl as ιο had been; that he was sure Maecenas¹ liberality was
bestowed upon him in a generoua spirit, and that he did not mean to compromiae his
independence; for if he could suppose such was the case, he would give up every
thing he had ever received rather than forfeit his liberty. He illustratos his position
by two storias-one that of the lox who got into a vessel of corn and grew so fat
there that he could not get out again (which Horace was determined ιο provo was not
his case), and the other a splenetic trick played by 11. Philippus upon a worthy man
whom he aedoced into leaving his home and vocation and aettling on a sarm in the
country, the result οι which unnatural change was the total destruction of his peace
and independencs. Το this ιοο Horace means to say he will never let himself be
brought.

There is nothing dimmpectiulor aogry in the Epiatle, though it might appear from
a bare outline like the above, or from a supertioial reading, that there was. It was
written after many years of intimacy, and shows pretty clearly the influenceHorace
had acquired with hia patron; for though Horace was not perhaps of a servile dis·
position, aa servility was then reckcned, he would not have assumed this tone nhc
had not ιοοο sure Maecenas would not tale offense at it. ”

There is no evidence to prove when this Hpistle was written. lt is generally attri-
buted to the sams year aa pr. 15, when Horace was meditating a winter residence on
tha coast. But the date of that Hpistlc is also quite uncertain, aud Horace in all pro·
bability passed most of his wintere elsewhere than et Ῑιοιοο.
