xxxii INTRODUCTION.

0. ii. ts-This Ode stands alone. The metm has its name from
Hipponax of Ephesus. The first verse consiste of three trochees,
followed by a single syllable, long οι· short:

-ol-el-olc

The second of five trochees preceded by suche syllable:

vl-ol-:l-ul-vl-c
O. iii. 12.—This Ode is also unlike any other. Itis usual ιο divide
it into feet called Ionio Minor ( υ u ,, ,), of which the two first verses
contain four each, and the third contains two. Respecting this metro,
see Bentley's note· It would seem that Horace, imitating the subject
of an Ode of Alcaeus (see Introduction), tried the metra also. The
Greek, as usual, hos a much finer effect than the imitation.

O. iv. 7.—This metro takes its name from Archilochus, and con-
siste of an hexameter verse, followed ιγ a verse which is the latter half
of a pentameter. There are no other Odes in this measure. '

Eped. i.-x.·-The first ten Epodes are in the same metre, consisting
of alternate trimeter and dimeter iambic verses. They admit spondeas ,
only in the uneven places. An anapaest is once introduced in ii. 35.

Eped. xt—This is one of the variations of tbe iambic introduced
by Archilochus. The first verse is a trimeter iambis. The second is
dcuvdpnyros, consisting of the last half of a pentameter followed ιγ a

dimeter iambic. This accounts for the short syllable in the middle of ,

vv. 6, 10, 26, aud the hiatus in vv. 14, 24. Bentley has a note on this
matre which may be consulted.

Epod. xiii-This metre consiste of an hexameter verse, with one
made up, as Eped. xi, of a dimeter iambic and half a pentameter, the
difference being that these parts are here reversed.

Eped. xiv, xv.-These are composed of an hexameter followed by a
dimeter iambic. '

Epod. xvi—This consiste of an hexameter verse, followed by a pune
iambic verse.

Epod. xvii-This consiste entirely of trimeter iambie verses, being
the only Ode that does so.

The rule laid down by Meineke, and adopted ιγ many editors, which
affirma that the Odes which consist of single lines, or lines in alternate

measure, are ιο be divided into stanzas of four verses, appears ιο me
too doubtful to be adopted.
