having sent llerus sny verses. He scys he hed warned him before he went thet he
should net be eble 1ο write ς that he had grown lazy. He reminds him too that he
hed originally only written verses 1ο bring himself into notice because hc was poor. ⁸¹11st
new he had not the 00000 metire. Resides he uss getting on in years, end peoplc's
testes were se verinus, and the noise and engagemente 01 the town so distracting, end
