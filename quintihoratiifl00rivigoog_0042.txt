HORATII FLAOCI

Seu rupit teretes Mersus eper plegae.
Me doctarum hederae praemia frontium

’ Dis miscent superis 3 me gelidum nemus eo
Nympharumque leves eum Satyris chori
Secemunt populo, si neque tibiae
Euterpe cohibet neo Polyhymnia
Lesboum refugit tendere barbiton.
Quod ei me lyricis vatibus inseris, 3⁵
Sublimi feriam sidere vertice.
