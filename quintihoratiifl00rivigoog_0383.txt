SATIRARUM I. 3. eal

hauded, let him be natural and manly; thepassionete, high spirited ;-this is the
way ιο make hiends and to lreep them. But we do just the reverse, turning virtues
into defects. Δι ιοιοοι man is a driveller ς ιιο slew and sure is ehog3 the prudent

“ and cautious, a liar and a ἴοις ιιο unsophisticated, e scol.

What rashness thus to establish a rnle which must react vupon ourselves. sn have
their faults, he ia best who has fewest. Let my friend weigh my good with my bad,
aud I will do the same by him. If hc would not heve his great deformities offeud
my eye, let him leem to overloolr my little oues: who would have indulgence must
show it.

In short, since the defects of fools, according ιο your Stoie theory, οοιιοι ιο got rid of,
it is reasonable we should judge others as we judge ourselves, end visit each fault with
no more than its dne censure. The meu who should orucify his slave for eating the
remnants of his ιιι must be med ; bnt he is not less mad who for some trilling fault
hstes his friend. Because a friend brealrs my old-feslnoned dish, or helpe himself
before me at table, em I ιο love him the lese for theti What if he were to commit
theit, or embezzlemeut, or fraud? They who declaro thet all faults are alike, ure
refuted by οοιιιιοι sense, expeaieuce, and expedieucy. Expedieucy is the parent of
justice: therefore meu when they were in their first rude state fought lilre beests for
their feod3 but when they ιοοιιιο civilized, expedieucy taught them ιο make lawa,
which every one must edmit were ιοιιοι ιο put down injusticc. Nature cannot draw
the distinction between right and wrong 3 nor will any argument convince us that a
petty theft is as bed as sacrilege. Let us visit each fault theu with its proper meed
of punishment ς thet is, let us not use the seourge where the whip is only due ; for 1
have no fear of your reversing this end substitutiug the whip for the soourge, though
you do say you would cut up ull vices elike if men would but make you king.

But are you nota lriugi Is not the wisc man rich and handsome, ecobbler aud a king?
Don't you know what our founder Chrysippus said i “ The wisa man never made him·
self a ehoe in his life, yet is the wisc man a cobbler.'' How is this? Why just es
Hermogenes is ιιο ιοοι of singers, even when his lips are closed, and Alfenius eon·
tinued ιο ιο a clover shoemalrer atter he had changed his trade and shut up his shop3
even so thewise men is the best end only worlrmau, end a lring. And yet thou king of

· lainga, the little boys mob thee und plnclr thy beerd! To malae along story short:
while your kingship goes down to a chesp bath with uo body-guard but Crispinus
the blockhead, my friends shall make allowsnce for my fenlts, and Iwill melre allow·
auce ior theirs, aud I shall live ae a subject more blest than you or any other king.
