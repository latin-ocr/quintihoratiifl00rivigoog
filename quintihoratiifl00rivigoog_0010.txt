poem in the form of an Argument. This serves the purpose of
giving a conspective view of the poem and its scope, and the con-
nexion of the different parts, and often supplies a word or sentence
which it otherwise might be necessary to translate in a note. The
Argumenta and Introductions will be found to relieve the notes
considerably.

Ihave donc my best to determine the merita cf the various
readings, and to choose in every disputed ease the best, according
tc my judgment. Ihave given in anote the amount of authority
for each disputed reading that I have adopted, and there is not a
word in the text which has not good MS. authority. “Lectiones
ex conjectura profectas tanquam pestem a contextu procul me
removisse dico¹.” 'Po those who are accustomed to loolr upon
Bentley as abenefactor to the text of Horace, this statement will
not be acceptabis. Ihave in no single instance adopted e con-
jecture of Bentley's or any body else’s², nor have I proposed any

myself. The antiquity, genuineness, and number of the MSS. of ·

Horace that have been collated by scholars of great respectability,
as well aethe authority of the Scholiasta and quotations in early

writers, all combine tc supply materials for a more perfect text of
Horace than we can get of almost any other writer. Opinions will

always differ as to the choicc cf readings, but to desert the MSS.
and resort to conjecture in the case of this author I hold to be
inexcusable. I have not seen the smallest excuse for it in any
single instance, and with this opinion I can only loolr upon the
, numerous conjectural readings of Bentley (nearly all of which Ι
have referred to in the notes) as sc many instances of false tasio
and perverted ingenuity. Orelli, who was not wanting in respect
for Bentley, says, “ conjecturae summi Critici, etsi semper sagaces
et acutae, admodum raro a circumspecto (tritico probari nune

accepted conjecturat readings; and he hes in some cases informed the reader that
they are conjectural. I believe however that tho editor has not admitted any of
Bentley's conjectures, and those which he has accepted hom others are few and not
like Bentlcy’s] ·
