HORA'PII FLAOOI

osanna inmun.

The extant elegies properly attributed to Tibullus mention only two mistresses of his,
under the names of Delia and Nemesis, and these are the only two that ovid mentions
in the beautiiirl elegy he wrote on that poet's death (Amor. iii. 9. 31, 55 sqq.). of the
person he calls Delia he was euamoured during the earlier pert of his life, of Nemesis
during his luter years. He died between thirty and iorty, about the same time ss Virgil.
Mnch has been written to prove that the Glycera of this ode stands for Delia (see par-
ticularly Spohn de A. 'libulli vite et eamr. p. 50, 96, who believes thet Delia, Nemesis,
Glycera, Neaera-a name occurring only in the third book, which libullus, it is pretty
certain, did not write, were all the same woman). Others have identified Glycera with
Nemesis, ou account oi the number and quantity oi the syllables being the same, and
the epithets Tibullus applies to her, ‘ avara? ‘rapax,’ 'saeva' ‘dura' which correspond
to Horaee's ‘ immitis? Dissen is certain that Glycera is neither Delia nor Nemesis, hut
another mistress otherwise unknown. Orelli isui the same opinion, but adds that those
who thus attempt to settle to auicety the loves ol Roman gentlemen, aud pretend to
know more about them than they have toldus, only create a smile among those who
have lived long in Franee or Italy-implying thet his countrymen were bad jndges of
the amusements of their more gallsnt neighbours. It is not even certain that 'libellus
wrote the pitiful elegies Horace speaks of. Glycera is one oi Horace's favourite uemoe,
and cannot be taken ior a real name here or elsewhere. 1t occurs in Plautus (Mil.
(ilor. ii. 5. 26) and Martini (xiv.187). Whethcr the person had any more reality than
the name or the verses, is, lthinlr, doubtful. Thai 'libnllus wrote elegies‚ that he was
not rsrely crossed in love, and that he was on some occasion in a desponding humour,
areimis sufficient to form a probable foundation fer this good-tempered little poem.
Whoever goes further thau this will lind he is out oi his depth.

Horace was much attached ie Tibullus, who was a favourite with his contemporaries.
To him was addressed the fourth epistle of the flrst book.

Come, Albius, do not be drawling pitiiul poetry upon Glycera, became she prefers a

admires the vulgu sinner as the she-goat loves the woli'. Such are Love’s diversions,
