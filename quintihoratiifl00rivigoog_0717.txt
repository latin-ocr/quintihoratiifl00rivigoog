when you should write. Wlnm vus the use of my doing so if uowyou uro ιο reprcech
me es if Ihed broken my word? .

(v. 26.) Au officer of Lucullns' one night while he wss eslcep hed ell his money end
equipments stolen. He beccum furious in consequence with himself us well es the
enemy, und while his blood wne up stormed und took oue of the king's strongest
pluces full of tresenre, for which he wus promoted end rewarded. nboue the seme
time the generul wanted to get possemien of u certain fortress, und calling the officcr
he says ιο him, ’θα my breve friend, go where thy vulour celle thee, ond great shull
he thy reward? ‘Nuy,' replies the cunning men, ‘send some one who hus lost his
purse?

(v. 41.) It wes my lot to begin my edueution ct Rome eud ιο linish it ut Atheus. Proin

· thence l ves hurried off to the disestrous were, und when I got my discharge et
Philippi, with my wiugs cropped, ehcru of my inherltsuee,1 wss driven by my
porerty ιο write verses. But now thet I heve enough,l should be med pestrecovery
if l did not count my eusc better then scribbling. 'lime is steeling every thing lium
me,-mirth, love, wine, sud spurt, end now it is taking poetry too. Besides peoplc's
testes differ so much. You like song, another likes iurnbics, u third course entire.
How cen 1 plesse you erl? 'fheu egnin how cun 1 write among ell the distractione
of the town? Here u mnu cells me to be his surety3 there ιο quit my business end
listcn ιο his hooks; one mun issick on the Quirinal, another et the extremlty of the
Averitine, und I must see them both, s pretty good distance you must ullow. ‘Ohl
but the streete ure so breed end clenr you esu think es γοα go ulong.¹ Why there
is every sort of obstrusum, contractors with their mules end porters, crunes swiuging
stenes und besuus over your head, funereis, mud dege, fllthy swlne ; l should like
γοα ιο muke verses iu suche scene us thet. 'l'he poet loves retirement und the
woods ; the student who hus been for yesrs poring over his books is rather ewkwurd
iu the world ς how ceu 1 write verses while the wuves sud storms of the city ere
rosring about me?

(v. 87.) Besides, these poete do nothing but pruise one suother. ‘A wonderful work!
surely ull the hluses hed u hend iu it ι’ How we hold up our heudo und stunt pest
tho librery which is one dey ιο hove s copy of our worksl We contest it like two
gludietors, end 1 come off un Alcaeus in his judgment, und he α Callimachus, nsy s
Mimnermus if he likes, in mine. 1 could hcer s good deul when l wus cenvessing for
eppluuse ; hut now thet 1 heve retired Ι shut my esrs to them ull.

(v. 106.) 'l'hough the public msy luugh et bed verses, their euthorssre well satisfled, sud
if γοα do uot pruise them, they will pruise themselves. But he who would write s
reel poem, must uct his own censor, sud cut out whut is bed, even if he keeps it still
locked up ethome. lle will not fuil tc reproduce obsolete but expressive words ss
well se new; he will pour along likeu rspid river, undenrichthelend with the copious
stream cf his cloqueuce; pruning, smoothing, erosing, the result will seem es eesy es
sport, like the milne who twists his limbs in the denos.

(v. me.) l hed rather, suys one, he looked upon us e feel, sud be sntislled with my own
performunces, then be ever so learned eud temnented ιο boet. He is like the gentlemun
et Argos, who used to funey himself sitting in the theetre, sud clspping the performers.
He wes perfectly sune in other respects, end when his friends recovered him from this
rnenin, he bitterly complnIned thet they hed tollen ewuy his pleesent illusion.

(v. 140.) But, efter sll. the best thing is ιο put nwsy child's play und poetry, end take
ιο philosophy. 'l'lrerefore 1 resson with myselfthus: ‘¹ lf yon hudu lever in your velus
γοα would spesk to the physiciuu. But if the more γοα here, the more γοα went, will
you keep thet to yourself f lf you found e particular remedy did γοα uc good, you
would uvoid thet remedy. Weh, you huveheerdmen ssy thetis e men hed money hc
hed wisdom: butif yon lind yoursclf no wiser now you ure richer, will γοα etich ια’
