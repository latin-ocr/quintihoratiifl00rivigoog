HORAI'II FLACCI

SATIRE VIII.

This Satira represents ιι dinner given by a rich vulgar man to Maecenas and live of
his friends. 'lbere is not so much todistinguishit in the way ot* humour as the subject
admitted ol. Few things 'present more soopc for saectioas satire than the airs of rich
meu, whose wealth is their one passport into what isculled good society. 'I'his is every

thet be writes t'rom a scene he had witnessed, Horace puts it iato the mouth oi bis
friend Fundanius, the comic writer mentioued in S. i. 10. 4211.

lt is impossible to conjecture with any probability the date of the Satine, though it
