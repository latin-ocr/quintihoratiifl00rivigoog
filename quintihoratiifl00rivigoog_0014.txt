The MSS. generally and most of the editions have inscriptions
or headings to the different poems. Γ11111 these were not given
them by Horaee himself is olear, but they appear in the earliest
MSS„ and are supposed by some to have been invented by the
grammarians almost contemporary with the author. They vary
