CARMEN XI.

The duta ol thia ede bae been much diacuaaed. If any argument could be founded
upon the flrat line, it would naturally be inferred that the Oenhbri aud the Scytbian
tribea wera in armaattbe timuit war written [and the date might be Ritter'e, auo.
725]Ι Ientulus’ expedition against the tribea ef the Danube, whohad invaded the
Roman provinces, ia auppoaed, aa 1 have auid before (C. 9. 23 n), ιο heve taken place
while Auguatuawaa in Spain. Supposing thia to be alluded ιο, the datc of the ede

only authority ou the auhjeet ia liores (av. 12), wbo doea net mention the date or give
any clue te it (aee O. iii. 8, lutrod). But al’eer all it ia not neemary ιο euppoae that
Horace meant auy thing very definite by thur coupling two dietant and troubleeome
enemlea together. Tha name Scythiae war applied to many peoplea, acme of whom
were contiuually giving trouble to the Romana ς aud aa llatrt aaya (p. 414),if Heraea

which ie merely te iutroduoe a convivial ode. He har prefixed to it a name we bear of
nowhere elea which hae mered a good deal ef difficulty to scholare. There ia ue Hir·
pinue on record but thia one, belonging ιο tbe Quintiae family er any other. whether
thiu perron wne a neighbeur ef Horeee'e, and get hia numa bom hia Sabine connexion
(the Hirpini were a Sabine people), or whether Horace gave acme ffiend thia name
from acme familiar whim unknown to ue, ia a matter oi doubt. It hae been aeaumed
that thia Quintius, aud the oue ιο whom ia addraaaed pr. i. 16, are the same. Butthe
latter appears ιο have been younger tbeu the former, whom Heraea addreaaaa aa if he
were a contemporary (v. 15). Cruquiua would substitute ‘Griapiue' ier ⁴ Hirpine! T.
Quintius Crispinus waa eonaul with Drunm nuo. 745, and it ia more probable that the
epietle above referred to war addreaaed ιο him than that thia ode waa. liually, ιο aup-
pose‚ with meat of the commentatore, that thia Hirpinus, whoever he wau, wau anervoua

topice of oenveraatien, ia enough ιο account l'or their introductieu here, without aup-
poaing that Horace er hie friend attached more weigbt ιο them thau other people.
