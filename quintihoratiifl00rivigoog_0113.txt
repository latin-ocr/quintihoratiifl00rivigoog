Queen osAntium, sil-powerfni to exalt or to debesa, the poor tenant cultivator worships
thee, and the mariner on the deep. Thon art feared by the sevage Dacian end nomed
Scythian, by all cities and natious, yse, by prond latium herself, by roysl mothers
membiing for their sons, and kings iecring for their crowns. Necessity with herstcrn

Ο nlvs, gratum qnae regis Antium,
Praesens vel imo tollere de gradu
Mortale corpus vel superbos
Vertere funeribus triumphos,

Ruris colonus, te dominam aequoris
Quicunque Bithyna lacessit

'Pe Dacus asper, te profugi Scythae
Urbcsque gentesque et Latium ferox ιο
Regumque matres harbarorum et

Injurioso ne pede proruas
stantem columnam, neu populus frequens
Ad arma cessantes, ed arma 15
Concitet imperiumque franget.
