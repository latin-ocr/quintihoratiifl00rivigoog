622 HORA'PII FLACOI

Quidquid eret noetus praedae majoris ubi omne
Verterat in fumum et cinerem, Noir hercule miror,
Aiebat, si qui comedunt bona, cum sit obeso

Nil melius turdo, nil vulva pulchrius amplo.
Nimirum hic ego sum3 nam tuta et parvula leudo
Cum res deliciunt, setis inter vilis fortis;

Verum ubi quid melius contingit et unctius idem
Vos sapere et solos aio bene vivere, quorum
Conspicitur nitidis fundate pecunie villis.
