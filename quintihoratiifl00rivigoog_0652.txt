616 HORATII rnnccl

Tu mediastinus tacita prece rura petebas,

Nunc urbem et ludos et balnea villicus optas;

Me constare mihi scis, ct discedere tristem

Quandocunque trahunt invisa negotia Romam.

Non eadem miramur 5 co disconvenit inter

Meque et te: nam quae deserta et inhospita tesca

Credis amoena vocat· mecum qui sentit, et odit

Quae tu pulchra putas. Fornix tibi et uncta popina
, Incutiunt urbis desiderium, video, et quod

Angulus iste feret piper et tus ocius uva,

Nec vicina subest vinum praebere taberna

Quae possit tibi, nec meretrix tibicina, cujus

Ad strepitum salias terrac gravis: ettamen urges
