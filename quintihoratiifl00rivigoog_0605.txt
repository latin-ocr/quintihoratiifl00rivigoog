EPISTLE IV.

Something has been said about Albius Tibullum, thepoet, ia the Introduction to 0. 1.
83, which is sddrassed ιο him, as this Epistle is. Horace writes to him (probably from
Rome) at his place near Pedum, a town of latium, not far from Praeneste, which, Por·
phyrion says, did uot exist in his day, aad the site of which is supposed to be occupied
by the modern town Zugal-ola 'libullus had a good estate there, inherited from his
father, which before his death he appears by some means ιο have diminished (S. i. 4.
28 n). 'lhat it was not by his own extravaganee, and that his losses must have oc·
eurred atter thia Epistle aas written, we may perhaps infer from r. 7. He alludes to
them in the first of his elegias (i. 1. 19 sqq.)r

“ Vos quoque, felicis quondam nune pauperis agri
Custodes, fertis munera vestra, hares;”

and in Lib. iv. 1. 181 sqq. there are some bittsr lineson the same subject. But it is not
probable that these lines were written by 'libellus 3 and ifnot, the languageof theelegy
above quoted ie not enough to prove that the diminution of the property tdok place
after it came into his possession. He might call his estate ‘pauperem agrum' by curm·
parison, aad he might still by Horace's standard be rich. He says in i. 1. 41:

‘⁸ Non ego divitias patrum, humusque requiro
Quos tulit antiquo condita messis avo.''

He may therefore be supposed te contrasthisestate with what it was in the times before
he cameto it, rather thau with its earlier condition under himself. Nevertheless there
are some who suppose that Horace wrote this Epistle to console Tibullus, and ιο chide
him for being melancholy, referring ιο v. 12. which, as Orelli says, contains nothing
more than a general description of human life. 'lhc description Horace gives of
'libudlus’ person is confirmed by an old biography, which calls him “eques &manus
insignis forma cultuque corporis observabilis.” He lived chiefly ou his estate in the quiet
pursuits Horace bere supposes him to be engaged in; but in huc. 723, immediately
after the battle of Aetium, he accompanied Messalla into Gaul und was absent about u
year, which as far as we know comprised all his active life, though Dissen hus endea-
voured ιο show that for ten years, from uum. 712 to 722, he 'served in the army.
Horace among other blessiugs assigna him good health ; nevsrtheless he died young. It
appears that while many disparaged Horace’s waitings Tibullus judged them kirtly,
und tha affection the two poeta bore one another cannot ba mistalren. Tibullus was
probably ten or twelve years younger than Horace. Various attcmpts have been made

to give adata tutha llpistle, but none are satisfactory to my mind. 'Tibullus died the
