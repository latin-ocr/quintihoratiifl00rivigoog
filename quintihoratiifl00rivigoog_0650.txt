whom he hsd promoted ιο that post from having been originally one of the lower sort
of slsves in the town establishmcnt. While iu thet position he sighed fur whst he
thought must be the superior ireedom oi the country ; but ss soon as he had roeched
the highest pisce he could be trusted with on the serm, he began ιο regnet the icrnser
