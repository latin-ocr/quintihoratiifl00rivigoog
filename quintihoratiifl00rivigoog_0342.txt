OARMEN XIV.

That Μοοοειιιι was not married, or engaged to be married, in a.n.c. 720, is inferred
hom the fact that in a letter written in that year to Augustusby hl. Antonius he taunta
him with carrying on an intrigue with Terentia (Suet. Octav. 69, quoted by lhanke).
Kirchner (Qu. Hor. p. 28) supposes Maecenas did not marry till he had built his house
on the Campus Esquilinus, auo. tal-22. liis domestic happiness was not of long
continuance. But he could hardly hare come ιο the end of it when Horace wrote this
ode, in which allusion is plainly made ιο Terentia and her husbead’s affection lor her
(supposing them to have been married at the time, and not merely betrothed, as Kirch·
ner imagines). These data leave a wide space for the composition of the ode. The object
of it is ιο excuse Horace for his indolence in not having finished a poem, or volume of
poema, he had long promised. It is generally assumed that this ‘carmen olim promis·
sum’ was the book of lipodes we now possess. If so, the ode was not written long before
the publication of the volume: for if it had long been promised and was anxiously
expected (aa Bentley says), we can hardly suppose that after being stirred up by his
patron, and with the leisare he must harahad at his imm, Horace would have kept
Maecenas aad all hisfriendsin fmther casperise for any length of tima especially when
we consider that the work was not au Aeneid, bnt a mere collectiones comparative
trillea some oi which must have been written early, and few ol them could have cost the
author any particular amount of thought. Now one ol these odes at least (O. ix.) was
written aelate as 728, being composed immediately alter the battle ol Actium, aad the
llrst is almost universally allowed to hare been written just ιοίοιο that battle. 'I'he book
therefore. under this explanation of ‘promissum carmen,’ was not published at the
earliest till towards the end clauc. 723, and thus the ode apologiaing for its delay
could not hare been written much before then. Franks assigna two odes (2 and 17) ιο
the following year ⁷24, while this apology he places in 721-22. Iu this case Horace
must heve gone on dawdling with his book at a very slow rata, which under these
cirmmstaneas it ie difficolt ιο soccum for.

After all it is doubtful whether ‘promissum carmeu’ means this bo'olr of Epodes.
Doering considera it certain that it was asingle poem (See note on v. 8.)
