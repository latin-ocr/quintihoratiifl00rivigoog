CARMINUM 11. 13. , 115

Quid quisque vitet nunquam homini satis
Cautum estin horas: navita Bosporum
Poenus perhorrescit neque ultra 15
Caeca timet aliunde fata,
Miles sagittas et celerem fugam
Parthi, catenas Parthus et Italum
Robur ; sed improvisa leti
Vis rapuit rapietque gentes.
Quam paene furvae regna Proserpinae
Et judicantem vidimus Aeaeum
Sedesque discretas piorum et
Aeoliis fidibus querentem
