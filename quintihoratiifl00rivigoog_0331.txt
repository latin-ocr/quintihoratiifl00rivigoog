CARMEN IX.

'ihc date of this ode cannot be mistelren. lt was written when the news of Actium
was fresh, in September, nuo. 723, immediately before the aith of the ilrst Book. It
is addressed to Maecenas, audit is impossible io read it and suppose he hed just arrived
from Actium, where some will have it he was engaged. As to Sanadon, he thinks

ARGUMENT.

When shall we drinlr under thy tall roof, Maecenas, to Caesar the conqueror, as lete we
did when the son of Neptune lost his lieet and fied—he who threatened us all with
the chains hia slaves had worn? erl our sons believe it? Romans have sold them·
salves to serre a woman and her eunucha, and the luxurious ganne heth fluitered
among the stendards of war. But their allice deserted to our side, and their ships
akulhed from the iight. lo Triumphe! bring forth the golden ohariot and the
sacrifice. So great a conqueror never came from Africa to Rome. 'l'he enemy heth
changed his purple for monrning, and hatb fied to Crete or the Syrtes, or knoweth
not whither to ily. Bigger oups, boy,-Chian, or Lesbien, or Cambete-we will
drown our old anxieties for Caesar in wine.
