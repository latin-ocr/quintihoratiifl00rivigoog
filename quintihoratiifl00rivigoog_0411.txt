SATIBABUM 1. 5.

SATIRE V.

In the year nmo. 714, aiter the taking of Perusia hy Caesar Octavianus, M. Antonius
prepared fer war, which was averted by an arrangement made thraugh the mediation οιΙ

Ι Maecenas ou the part of Caesar, and of Cocceius and Pellio on the part of Antonius, aud

by the marriage of Octavia,Caesar's sistentohntenius. But thatthis wusnetthc occasion
of the journey recorded iu this Satira is certain, because Horace was not introduced to
Maecenas till the beginning cf nuo. 716. The same objection‚ among several others,
is fatal tc the theory which connects the jouruey with the spring of the year 716. At
that time M. Antonius arrived at Brundusium with his dect at the aequest of Caesar,
who had ashed him Tor help against Sex. Pompeiam 3 but not finding Caesar there, he
very soon took his departure. This is the date adopted, arnong many others, by Hein-
dort'. It has been dispcsed oi hy Kirchner (Quaest. Hor. 656 sqq.) iu away that can·
not be auswered.· In the spring of the following year 717, Antonius brought over an
army tc Italy, aud a fleet οιΙ 300ships (Appian, v. 98 ; Dion (lass. 48. 54; Plut. Ant.
c. 35): ἔκ τινοιν διαβολῶν παροξυνθεὶς πρὸς Καίσαρα, says Plutarch. He pretended,
Dion says, ιο come t'or the purpose of helping ιο put down Sex. Pompeius, but his real
object was rather ta see what was going ou than to take any active part. He came te
Brundusium, but the people would not let him inte the harbour (according te Plu-
tarch), and he therefore went οιι to Tarentum. Negotiations were carried un between
the two rivale (Caesar being at Borne) through agents employed by both, but without
effect, till Octavia undertook to mediate between her husband and brother, and was
finally successful in reconciling them. It has been supposed, with every probability,
that the mirsion which Horace accompanied was seut by Caesar ιο mest Antonius on his
expected arrival at Brundusium on this occasionis the spring of nmo. 717. Thst the
seasou was not winter may be inferred from v. 14, where Horace speras of being dis·
turbed by the gnata and fraga That it was not summer is probable from the party
requiring a dre at Trivicum (v. 80). Appian states expressly that Antonius arrived
at Brundusium ἦρος ἐρχομένου, which corresponds with the above facts.

Horace started from Rome with only one campanieu, Heliodorus the rhetorician
(v. 2), aud they travelled together three days aud one night, sixtyone Roman miles, till
they reached Thrracina or Anxur, where by appointment they were to meet tha official
members oi their party. These were Maecenas and Cocceius, who had been employed
iu negotiating the first reconciliation between Caesar aud Antonius, and Fonteius,
an intimate friend af Antonius. Three days asterwards they met st Sinuessa Horace's
three most intimate friends, Plotius Tucca, Varius, and Virgi13 οιιο of whom, Varius,
kept thern company only for six days, and lert them, fer reasons which are not men-
tioned, at Canusium (v. 93). The rest of the party went ou together till they reached
Brundusium, dsteen days atter Horace had nn Roma The route they took was not
the shortcst er the easiest, which lay through Venusia aud Tarentum. They preferred
taking the read which strihes across the country from Beneventum, aad, reaching tha
coast at Barium, continues along the shore till it cemes to Brundusium. They were
evidently not pressed for time, and probably took the read they did because it passed
through Canusium, whither one of the party was bound. Maecenas made his jouruay
as agreeable aa under the circumstances it could be, by taking with him such cern·
lenione, and they all appear to great advantage iu Horace’s good-humoured diary.
'there was uo restrdat between the patron and his friends, aud their affection for him
and one another it is very pleasant ιο contemplato.
