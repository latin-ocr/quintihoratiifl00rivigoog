SATIRE VII.

Ido not think many persone will agree with Franks in hie high estimate ot' this
Satira, thebert ot its kind, he says, and yiclding to nono or even preferable to all
others, in elegance of composition, suavity of diction, and dmrnatic power. He wishes
te prove thet it wae not tho earliest of the Satires, as most commentatore suppose, some
judging from the quality, others withmere reason from the subject. The subject ies
dispute, travectied 1 think without much humour, between ouc of the officere on Bmtus’
staff aud a merchant of Clazomenae (a town on the Guli' ot' Smyrna), aaieing it may bc
supposed out of some money tranmctions. Horace treats the matter much in the same
way as the disputa got up between the two parasitee for the amusement of Maecenas
end hie friends at Caudium (S. 5. 51 eqq.). He no doubt bad some meon for disliking
Rupilius, which thc Scholiasta supply, whether with any sufficient authority it is impos·
sible to say. They tell ue that this man'r native place wae Pmenestc (which may be
gethered from v. 28); that he was bauislred from that town by hie follow-citimus ς that
hc then serrcd in effice in the army oi Attius Varus, propraetor of Cn. Pompeium
that he was received into favour by C. Julius Caesar and made Proetum that aiter
Ceosar’s death hc was proscribed hythe triumviro and joined the army ol Brutus.
l'inally, that he was diegusted et Horace, a man ol low birth, being made a military
tribune, and contiuually insulted him, which indignities Horace retorted in this Satire.
Persius, the Scholisst says, was born oi a Greek father end a Roman mother. Boyond
this, which may or may not bc truens know nothing about him except what we gether
from thie Satira, that he wne a wcalthy man and carried cn a largo business of some
kind at Clazomenae. Dillenbr. supposes he was employed as contractor for the supply
ot' corn in Brutus’ army, aad that hie dispute with Rupilius arose out of transactione
connected with this business. D. and others (Spohn in Jahn'e edition of Horace, ed. 2nd,
p. 257) identify the hero of thie Satire with P. Rupilius Menenia (that ie, οἲ the 'lkibue
Menenia), the Roman ‘eques’ and ‘publicanae' recommended by Cicero to Crassipes
the Quaestor of Bithynia (ed Fam. xiii. 9). These th00riee are hardly worth men·
tiouing in a case of eo much obecurity. Comm. Cmq. eaye Persius was a ‘negotiator’
et Clazomenae. But the ‘negotiatores' (money-leaders) in heia and the other pro·
’ vinces were not nativas (es Persius seenre to hare been), but Roman ‘equites' 'l'hey
were au importent cleee, who gave no little trouble tc the governore (Cic. ad Qu. Fr.
i. 1, c. 1), and their commercist transactione in Asia particularly were on a large
scale. une diepatc arose when Brutus and his army were in Asia Minor, which was in
auc. 711-712 (see note on v. 18). How soon afterwards the Satira wae written it ie
impossible to say; not long, 1 think. lt may have been made ou the spot, end shown
to those who would find most amusement in it, in the camp. I think thie ie mere
likely than that Horace should have reverted to euch asubject ester hiearrival at Rome,
