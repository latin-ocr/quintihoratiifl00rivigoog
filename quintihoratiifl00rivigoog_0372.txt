HORATII FLACCI

saules Π.

run Satira appears to hare beau written ou the death cf Tigellius, a musician of
great reputo, who, ae we lcaru from tha opening verse of the next Satira, had been on
terme of familiar intimacy with C. Julius Caesar. The Scholiasta who call him M.
Hermogenes rigentur sy suae ue aemam wama aravouse wilh oepha ane
then again with Augustus. Acron says Horace quarrelled with him ιοοοοεο ιο found
fault with the rhythm of his verses. It is probable that this Tigellius ismiscailed H.
Hennogeues, and that tbis name belongs only to another 'ligellius who was also asingcr
mentioned iu S. 8. of this book, 129 ς 4. 723 9. 25 ς 10. 18, 80, 90. These persons had
never been separated till Dacier distinguished them. Heindorf adheres tothe old opinion,
which 1 think has been satisfactorily dispoeed of by Kirohuer in histreatisa “ De Utro·
que 'ligellio” (Quaest. Hor. p. 42 sqq.). Theligellius of this Satira is called Sardus,
a Sardinian, in the next (r. 8). It appears from the Scholiasta that he was attached
by Licinius. from whom they quote this verse: “Sardi Tigelli putidum caput veuit.'’
lle wne probably therefore elibertinus. Cicero had aquarrel with this person whose

influeuce with Caesar was euch that it made him rather anxious, though he affecte iu '

some of his lettere to hold the roan chcap. Compare Epp. cd Ham. vii. 24. Ad stt.
xiii. ss, 50, and 51'. He too alludea to Licinius’ verse, aud calls Tigellius “ hominem
pestilentiorem patria sua (the climate of Sardinia was ccuuted very bad), eumqueaddie·
tum jam dudum Calvi Licinii Hipponacteo praeconio'' (sd. Fam. 1. ο). ’Ῑιο cha·
racter of Tigellius is drawn cleverly iu the opening verses of the next Satire.

'lire statement of tbe Scholiasta ou v. 250f this Satira, that some supposed (so Porph.
and Comnw Oruq. put it ; Acron says at once “Maecenatem tangit '') that, under the
name Malchiuus, Horace means ιο satirica Maecenas, seems to me unworthy of the least
credit. But it has had warm defendere, and upon this assumption the date of the Satira
hired, both Kirchuer aud Eranke placing it in amo. 714, iu order ιο allow sufficiant
time between the composition of the libel aad the introduction of Horace to hie patron.
1 will not trouble the reader by going iuto the argument, except to say that, if the libel
was lrsen enough ιο offeud, it is aa improbable Horace would have publishsd as that he
would have written it after his introduction to Maecenas ς and if (as appears to rue) there
isnothiugtooffend iu the verse, it was aa probably written afoerae before their acquaint-
ance began. But 1 donet believe Maecenas had any thing ιο do with the verse at all
Au early date must be assigned ιο the Satira, because it certainly preceded the 4ιι, md
that again was compoeed before the lOth oi this Book. Whether the coarseuess of the
ideas aud lauguage, aud tha want of artistic arrangement and connexion, may not ιο
an argument for an early date, deservea consideration. (See Introduction to S. d) It
is without exception the coarsest of all Horace's Satires, and, with reference to the point
it professes ιο turn upon, the least to the purpose. 1 cau truce no connexion between
the text which is contained iu v. 24 (“fools tryiug to avoid one class of vices ruu into
their opposites'’) and the licentioua lauguage aud advice contained in the latter half of
the Satira, which in brief amounte to this: ‘do not let afalse ambitiou lead you into
intriguing with married women, hut melre yourself happy with pmstitutes! The
examples which appear ιο be to the purpose are not so in reality. ligallius, wc‘may he
sure, did not give his money ιο harlots aud impostore iu order to avoid the character
of a miser ς nor did Fufidius drive hard usurious bargains, cheat young rnen with good
expectatione, and deuy and torment himself, iu order to avoid the charge of extrava-
guuee. If ons man wore his tunic down ιο his ancias, it was because he was sloveuly or
effeminate5 if another tuclred his up so aa to exposa his person, it was ιοαιοοο hewse
