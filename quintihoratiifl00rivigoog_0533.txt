SATIRARUM ΙΙ. t.

Ante meum nulli ¹patuit quaesita palatum.

Sunt quorum ingenium nova tantum crustula promit.

Nequaquam satis in re una consumere curam,

Ut si quis solum hoc mala ne sint vina laboret,

Quali perfundat pisces securus olivo.

Massica si caelo suppones vina sereno,

Nocturna si quid crassi est tenuabitur aura,

Et decedet odor nervis inimicus3 at illa

Integrum perdunt lino vitiata saporem.

Surrentina vafer qui miscet faece Falerna

Vina columbino limum bene colligit ovo,

Quatenus ima petit volvens aliena vitellus.

Testis marcentem squillis recreabis et Afra
