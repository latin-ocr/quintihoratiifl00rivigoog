. ‘Scribe decem s Nerio!

'ihs rcsding in the teat is ‘Scribe decem Nerio’ sud ii that is the true reading, the
explanationin the notes msy bs es good ss any other. But ss the reading ‘scribe
decem a Nerio' hes the better authority, we must attempt ιο explain it. 'lbere is no
occasion ιο show bere ιιιι ‘decem' mesns s snm of money. 'l'hct is proved clearly in
the note on S. ii. 3. 69, sud ι] Krliger in ι usehrl excursus on this passcgc. The expla-
nstion of Orchi snd Ritterthat ‘decern’ means ‘decem tubulas’ is a acutulis which
we could hardly expect sucb'excellent commentatore ιο make.

We must next consider what ‘scribe s Nerio¹ means. The prepositiou ‘ab ' is thus
used in ι passage of Cicero (pre Flacco, c. 19, quoted ι] Krdger), ·si praetor dedit, ιιι
cst scripturn, ι quaestore numerarim qusestor ι mensa publics; mensa ant ex vectigali
ιιιιι ex tributo :’ which means, the praetor psid ι] an order on the quaestor ι the quse·
stor gsve nn order on the public bank, sud flnslly the henli pcid the money οιιι oi
the funds which it hed in possession. ‘Phe passage in Livy (24. c. 18, ‘n quamtors
perscribcbstur ’) may also be compered with this in llorsce.

'l'he conclusion is that ‘scribe decem ι Nerio' expresses a psyrnent of money made ι]
the banker Nerius to sums borrower, und mede pursusut ιο the order oi some leuder,
who ιιι] be Perillius (v. ¹74, ‘Perilli dictantis quod ιιι numquam rescribere possis ').
The sutry in ιιι books of Nerius oi the locu mudc on the order oi Perillins would bs
evidence eguinst the borrower, ior the entry would bs made with his knowledge and
consent. As 'seribere’ hers expresses the lendingol' the money, ao ‘resmibsrs ³ expresses
therepeymentr ior the evidence of the repaymsnt would be sn sntry in the books
which would beve the effect oi snuulling the entry οι the debt.

If it should be sslted ιο whom is the word ‘scribe' addressed. ιο ιιι lender or thu
borrower, the snswer iethet it is not necessary ιο suppose the word to he sddressed ιο
either. Ιι means no mere then ‘suppose Nerius to sdvance s sum of money to ι bor·
rower upon the order oi ι lsnder.' Further, ‘supposes hundred written securitiea
besides, such securitics ss wily Cicuta employs.' All these words in the second person,
‘scribe’ ‘udde' ‘repies,' ‘tu rescribere possis’ mnstbeiuterpreted generally: ‘suppose

ι ιιι rnonsy lent ;' ‘suppose theadditionsl written securities ;¹ ‘suppose the debtor brought

into court3' and lsstly, in ‘tu nunquam rescribere possis,' ‘tu’ is Damasippus or any
rnen who bonuws and does not repsy.

A like use oi ¹ adde' occurs in S. ii. 3. 321, ‘ sdde poemets nuuc!

'l'he passage, though it is difficolt end hss given ιιι commentatore much trouble, is
perleotly plsin, ii wc loolr at it in the right wsy. Kriiger's is the only true explanation
that I have seen. G. Ia.
