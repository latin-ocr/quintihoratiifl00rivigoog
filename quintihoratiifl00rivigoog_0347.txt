OARMEN XVI.

'iliis ode is written with grest eure, end wss probsbly one of those compositione by
which llorsee brought himself into public notice. Ithss more the eppesrnnce of having
been written for time then nny other in the boolr. Ι heve no doubt it wss written soon
niter Horace csme ιο Rome st the outbreulr of the Perusisn wer, sne. 718. Some
follow whst they suppose ιο ιο ιιο meaning of the Scholisst Acron, who ssys on the
word ‘Altero’ (v.1)= “ quondo Antonius dimicavit contre Augustum.'' But hs msy
hsve referred to L. Antonius the consuly st any rete the lengusge und continents ere
so different from any thet Horuee used or wes likely to use sbout the time of Actium,
‚ thet the ode connot be referred to thet period. The stete oi Rome et the time sup-
posed isdescribed very vividly by Appisn (Bel. civ. v. 18-49) and Dion (xlviii. 9-15).
It hus been supposed thet the notice of migreting to the fortunate munds, which many
nithe commentatore hove tehen too liternlly, was derived from the words of sonorius,
recorded by Plutarch in his life (c. 8), end ssid by the Scholisst heron to heve been
mentioned by Sallust. When he was hard pushed by Luscus the legate of Sulls,¹ Ser-
torius, falling in with some seilors who hsd visited or been driven ιο ιιο Westeru
Islsnds end hearing hom them s glowing description oi their climate, is suid to heve
conoeivsd s desire to go snd live there, snd so ιο get n'd of ιιο troubles of his life end
the never-ending were. Sertorius’ speech msy heve become notorious, or Horace msy
hsve hcerd oi it 3 but the ides mey heve occurred ιο him independently or been sug·
gested, us the description seems in pert ιο heve been, by Pindsr's description of the
Heppy lslsnds (01. ii. 70 sqq.), snd Hesiod's of the same (Op. οι Di. 167)= wis ei six·

hind, snd the dove with the hswlr, snd the herde fesr not the lion, ond the begeat
shell love the usses-then we will return ιο our home. Thus let the nobler spirits
resolve while the osuven clings to his conch. For us there cre those hsppy isles where
the eerth yields her hurveets sud the trees their fruit unbidden; where honey drops
from the σοι, snd ιιο sti-eom leops bebbling from the hills; where the gost eomes

groundbeers no cipes-3 where the rein-flood snd the drought ure not lruown3 thther
the venturoue seil cemes not; where the floels is unhurt by pestilenco or hest. Jove
destined these shores for the picus when the golden ege hsd passed swsy, end thither
the picus msy resort snd prosper.
