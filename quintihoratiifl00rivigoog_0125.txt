CARMEN ΙΙ..

Horace, meaning ιο write au ode on the moderate desire und use oi weaith, dedicated
it ιο O. Sallustius Crispus, grand-nephew ol the historiari and inheritor ol hia property.
lle hsd previously alluded to him in no terma of prsise in Sat. i. 2. 48; but that Satire
was written many years before this ode, and at this time Sallustius was in high favour
with Augustus and possessed of great riches, of which Horace implies that he made a
good use. From the reference to Phraates’ return to his throne (v. 17), which toolr
place nuo. 724 (see Ο. i. 26, Introduction), tha ode must have been written alter that
event. Proculeius mentioned in v. 5 was brother or cousin (it is not certain which) ιο
Licinius Murena, resonuerat was detected in a conspiracy with one Fannius Caepio
to take away thalisa of Augustus (see C. ii. 10, Introduction). 1 cannot infer so posi·
tively aa Franks and others do that Horace would have abstained from mentiouing the
generosity oi’ Proculeius, ifhis relation's crirne had been committed when he wrote ; but
that chronologist telres this allusion as an argument that the ode was written between
auu. 729 und 732, andfrom the tone of the allusion to Phraates he supposes his resto·
ration to have been recent, and walgras the ode to the year 730, in which Orelli and
· Dillenbr. agree with him.

ARGUMENT.

Silver heth no beauty while hid in tha earth Sallustius, who despisest the ore till it is
polished by moderate use. Proculeius for hie generosity to his brethren will live l'or
ever, and the man who rules the spirit of svarioe is s greatm iring thau if hom Car·
thags to Gades were aii his own. Tho dropsy grows and grows till its cause is ex·
pelled. Phraates restoredto his throne ia not happ53 he only is alring and conqueror
who looks on money with indifference.
