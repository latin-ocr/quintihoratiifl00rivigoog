SATIRARUM 11. 7.

SATIRE VII.

The substance cf this Satire Horace puts into the mouth of his slcve Davus, giving
him liberty to express himself as he pleaees on the dsy of the Saturnalia, when much
licence was granted tc slaves in porticulsr. Davus takes advantage of tbe pennissiou
given him ιο abuse his mester, and ιο ιαααι ιιο rich with o slavery (ιο their passione
end ιο ιιο world) hurder and more stupid than his own. He also taunts Horace with
his instability end wealmess ol purpose, which part cf the Satire appears to me ιο ιο
ιιο most naturul and amusing (see note on v. 23). The rest contains a great deal that
is disngreeable und much thot ia common-place. It may perhaps represent the habit
os talking trssh under the name of philosophy, which those who pretended ιο ιο of the
Stolo school hod established, end the humour would be rurore perceptible to a Remum
of the duy than it is now. The commentatore spealr highly of the wit of this Satire,
but moetos them make little distinction, and=praise ell elilso.

'l'here is no traco οἷο date in the Setiae, but some think it pmbnble thet as S.8 was
written οι one Satumelia, and this makes mention ci tho same festival, and touches
like the other upon Stoic doctrines, it was perhaps written a year aller the above. 1
dc not sce any force in this, nor does it sppesr necessary to suppose the Satine was
writtesl at or ueer the Saturnalia. 'lbet wey ol introducing the subject might have
suggested iteelf st any time cf the yeer.

ARGUMENY.
1 have been long u listener, my moster, sud though 1 wish ιο say a lew words, 1 lrnow

my position, end am afraid.

Is thet Davus?

Esou eo, Davus your indifferent good slave.

Well, it's the Saturnalia: you msy spealr.

There are some men who ere consistent in vice3 others who ero always honering
between right and wrong. There'a Priscus, a man who changes every honr from

the top ιο ιιο phin man, from the stately ιο the humble, from the mire to the
philosopher, the very type of mutability. Volunerius the gemester, when he could
no longer hold tho dice-box t'or the gout, hired ο ιογ ιο do it for him. But he iu
his consistency wne better off then the other rnen in his incomistency.

What does sll this refer tc, you rescal?

'l'c you.

What do yon mean, sccundrell

Why you profess ιο prsiae the good old times, but wouldu't go baclr ιο ιιοαι if γοα
might. In the town γοα pinc l‘or the country, iu the country you cry up the town.
1r you ure not invited cut, yon pretend γοα cre glad to stay at home ς if an invitation
comes, off you ily und lceve your poor guests in the lurchr gluttons they erc no
doubt, but are you less ac yourself?

Suppose 1 should prove that you ere sillier even then 1 your slave? Don't be ungry,
and 1 will tell you what 1 hese picked up st the philosopher’s.

This man goes after hia neighbours wife, 1 siber a common women: which of ns
deservea most ιο ιο henged? 1 incur no disgmce snd no danger. Yon are obliged
ιο put cn all scrts of disguiscs, trembling with ο mixture of lust ond leur. Why
you might as well go hire yourself for a gladiator ss submit ιο ιο tuclred into a box
to escape un angry husband. Yon are much worse then the woman you seduco, end
deservo c heavier punishment. 1r you get out of the scrupe, of course you'll talse
care αοι tc get into it again. Not u bit. Yon will secli the first opportunity
