CARMINUM ΙΙ. 6. 97

'lhedsfeof this ode brubeenmuch discussed. listrd plecesit very soonafter llorsoe's
first urrirsl οι Rome, when he was fresh from thefatigues of wsr, which the expression
‘Sit moduslasso muris striarum Militisequs' seems tofuvour. But u young men just .
returning borne to begin life does not hegin by writing about a retreat for his declining
years. 'l'hereis s character about the ode which belongs to sister period. He must
have been fsmilisr with Tibur and Tarentum endotherlocslities which heslludes to. 'l’be
allusion to the Cantabri in v. 2 is supposed by others ιο fix the date much later, nsmely,
iu nuo. 729, when Augustus wss engaged in reducings rebelliou iu Spsiu. Αι any time
before mmo. 725, when the Cantabri were first reduced, they could heva been called by
Horace ‘indoctos juge ferre nostra' even though no etfempt bad been mede to impose
thet yolus. lu 725 they were reduced ιο subjection; in 728 they broie out again, snd iu
the following yser they were finally subdued‚ though un unimportant disturbando hadto
be put down by Agrippa some years afterwards (see C. iii. 8. 21; iv. 14. 41. Epp. i. 12.
26). If therefore the ode wss written after 725, it must hare been in the beginning of
729 οι· thereubouts, md 1 em inclined ιο think thet wss the date, though 1 sdmit the
dillioulty of understsndiug why Horace should speels of himself even poetimlly us tired
of wnrfsre and the sea, so many years efter he hed eosaed ιο hove any thing todo with
either. Tbst he does not spcnk of his Sabine form, but gives the preference ιο Tibur
or Tarentum, proves nothing. Long efter he hed possession of his furm, he expresses
his preference for those pisces (lipp. i. 7. sl) r-

- ‘⁸ mihi jum non regis Romu,
Sed vacuum Tibur pleeet aut imbelle 'furentum’'

(See niso 0. iii. 4. 21 sqq.) 'l'bst he frequented Tibur iswell known. Some say he
owned, some he rented‚ a small property there. It may, however, be doubted atter sll,
perhaps, whether Horace must ba tehen ss speaking strictly of himself. Ηο ruay only
mesu, in effect, that the weery need seelr no hnppier testing-place thau libor or Taren-
tum, though he puts the matter iu the form of s wish for himself. lt wes probably on
or aster u visit ιο Septimius tlmt llorsce composed the twenty-eighth ode of the first
boois; and, probably with the attractione of Tarentum fresh iu his mind, he wrote thia
ode. But homey have poid his friend muny visits.

Septimius, who ert rssdy to go with me to the ends of the earth, Ῑ would that 1 might
end my days at Tibur, or, if that be forbidden me, at Tarentum. Abone all others l
