' ARGUMENT.

No gold in my roof, no marble ιιι my hall, no palace have I, nor female cliente ιο ιιιιι
me, but I have houeaty and under-standing, and though I be poorl am courted by
the rich: what more should 1 ιιι of the gode or my friend, content with my ainglo
Sabino estete? Days ure passing ou, aud, though readyto drop into thy grave, thou
art building aud etretchiug thy bordera, aud teat-ing up the laudmarlra of thy client,
ιιιιι driving him from ιιι home. Butto what purpose ia thia? Το Hadea thou must
go iu the anda ιιι earth openeto rich aud poor ς Prometheus the craity, and Tantalus
the proud, they cannot eacape ι aud the poor man finde in death a release from ιιι
ιοὶιι, whether ιι ιιιιι ιι οι not.
