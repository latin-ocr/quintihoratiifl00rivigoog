Preface has laid down a scheme determining the dates of the several
books, without stating the grounds on which he founds it. It
will be seen that Ι prefer Franke's opinion on this subject to
1110010οΗ0, but that there are many instances in which his zeal
appears to outstrip his judgment in determining the date of
particular poems.

Of 110 other books that I have used I have 1000 most indebted
to Estre's Prosopographeia Horatiana (Amsterdam, 1846), a most
favourable specimen 01 industry and judgment.

Ihave studied with much pleasure the fragments 01 theGreelr
Lyric poeta, with whose entire works Horace must have been

tried to confine myself to such passages as throw light upon the
text, or appear to have been imitated by or copied from Horace.
When I have met with a quotation in any of the late commentatore

name. Where, 00 the other hand, as is the case very often, the
quotation is only 000 01 the common stoclr that has accumulated
from the Scholiasts downwards, I have given credit for it to 00 one,
but do not on that account wish to have the credit 01 it myself.
If any have been suggested by my'own memory or reading, I have
not inquired whether others had thought of them before, and shall
hope that I may not appear to havc defrauded any one. I have
