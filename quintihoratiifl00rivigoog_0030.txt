time. It seems from the Epistle ιο Florus that Horace at this time
had to resist the urgeney of friends begging him ιο write, one in this
style and another in that, and that he had no desire ιο gratify them and

· to sacrifice his own ease to a pursuit in which it is plain he never took

any great delight. He was likely ιο bring ιο it less energy‚ as his life
was drawing prematurely ιο a close through infirmities either contracted
or aggravated during his irrational campaigning with Brutus, his inepti·
tude for which he appears afterwards ιο have been perfeetly awarc of.
He continued ιο apply himself to the study of moral philosophy till his
death, which took place on the 27th November, nuo. 746, or nc. 8,
in the fifty-serenth year of his age, and within a few days of its eomple-
tion. Maecenas died the same year, also towards the close of it3 a
coincidencethat has led some ιο ιιο notion that Horace hastened his
own death that he might not have the pain of surviving his patron.
According ιο Suetonius his death (which he places aster his fifty-ninth
year, as the text erroneously stands) was so sudden that he had not
time to executa his will, which is opposed ιο the notion of suicide. The
two friends were buried near one another “in extremis Esquiliis,” in
the farthest part of the Esquiliae, that is probably without the city
walls, on the ground dmined and laid out in gardana by Maecenas.

'Phe plan adopted in this Edition, of commenting on each poem in a
separate Introduction, rendere it unnecessary to say much in this place
upon Horace's style and character. The particular style in which his
principle strength ley will be always matter of opinion. My own is, that
he is nowhere so greca as in the Odes, and that of these his genius is
best shown in the Odes that relate to public affairs or men, while in some
of the small occasionel pisces, as the Ode to the Fountain of Bandusis,
that on the death of Quintilius, and others, much grace and feeling
are show'ir'. Icannot at all agree with those who think that amatory
verse-aviting was Horacs's strong point. With rare exceptione his
compositione of this kind, however elegant they may be, appear frigid
and passionless‚ bearing the stamp of imitation, with unequivoeal signs
of art, and none of nature. The crowd of mistresses that have been
gethered for him out of his poema is beyond belief3 and the laborious
folly that has tried to classify his amours, and to follow chronologi·
cally the shifting of his affectione, 1 have had occasion to notice.
It proceeds upon an interpretation of the Odes which is foreign to
their true character. Horace was neither more nor loss licentious pro·
bably than most of his contemporaries, though his biographer Suetonius
charges him with gross sensuality3 but, however this may be, that the
women of his Odes are in nearly every instance fictitious I have no
doubt whatever. Cinara⁵ seems to representa real person; and with
