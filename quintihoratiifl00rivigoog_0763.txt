Ans POETICA. 72⁷

Sic honor et nomen divinis vatibus atque soc
Carminibus venit. Post hos insignis Homerus

Tyrtaeusque mares animos in Martia bella

Versibus exacuit3 dictae per earmina sohtes 3

Et vitae monstrata via est, et gratia regum

Pieriis tentata modis 3 ludusque repertus

Et longorum operum finis: ne forte pudori

, Sit tibi Musa lyrae sollers et cautor Apollo.

Natura fieret laudabile carmen aa arte

Quaesitum est: ego nec studium sine divite vena

Nec rude quid possit video ingenium alterius sie 410
Altera poscit opem res et conjurat amice.
