546 HORATII FLAOCI

ARGUMENT.

Maecenas, more honoured theu all the world,l heve received my discharge ι seek uot to
cull ure baclr ς my years und my inclinatione ure not what they were. Let me hang
up my arms oud retire. A waruiug voice within bide me loose the ugud steed leet he
stnmhle at the eud of his course. Verso Ι luy sside, eud turn ull my thoughts te
philosophy aud virtue, sud am leyiug up stores of these.

(v. 13.) Ι belong, if you ask rue, ιο uo school, sud own ιιο mester, but sm borno along
whererer the breeze may set: now ull activity aud virtue with the Stoice, now insen·
sibly falling into the laxity of Aristippus. The duys are wesry till 1 shall have learnt
ιο act out whut neither rich nor poor, young nor old, cun neglect with impunity.
Meuutirue Ι ceu ouly telus the little knowledge 1 here for my gulde eud comfort.
If we oeuuot resch perfectiou, we may advauce towards it. There are cher-ms in
philosophy for every diseaso. Ambitiou, cury, passion, sloth, iutemperauce, lust· all
thet is most savuge maybe tsmed if it tnru unwilling ear to instruction. 'l'ho first
step iu virtue sud wisdom iu to abendon vioe eud folly. For instance, you who are
husteuiug to berich, und flyiug from the disgrace of poverty, will yon not leuru froru .
the wise to despise those things you love so foolishly? Would the boxer- who iights

' iu the streete despire the Olympio crowu which should be offered him without a
blow?

(ι. 52.) Believe me virtueis ebore the worth of gold, though the whole Forum may say
otherwise, und old und young may learu the loeson, cryiug, ‘Mouey first sud theu
virtue? Be uble, good, eloquent, honest, es you will, let your property fsll short bnt
by a little of the equestriau sud you uro uobody. Neron miud; thechildreuwillosll
you Kiug if you do well. Lot this be your stroughold, a conscience void of offence.
Which is best, lloecius' law or the boys’, which the good old soldiers Curius uud
Camillus approved? Which is your best adviser, he who hide you get money how you
osu, that you muy sit a little uearer the¹ stege, οι· he who stuuds ever at your clbow
end bids and teuchos you to defy the caprices of Fortuue?

(v. 70.) And if 1 be ssked why 1 hold not the opinions of the world I mix with, my
auswer is that which the fox luade ιο thc lion: became 1 see all the footurarlrs turned
towards your deu aud noue the other wey. Whorn or whut sm 1 to follow? Oue
mauis getting rich by oue foul way aud another by another, aud uo oue is consistent
even with himself. Amen telles a fsucyto build on the constet Baiae: the next day
he is oli iulaudto Teauuru. If he is mer-ried, he wishes himself a buchelor ; if not, he
wishes he was. And even the poor mou, he must chunge his lodgiugs uud his furuiture,
aud hire himself a boet to spe the rich mau’s yucht. '

(v. 94.) And you too, my friend, you lungh at me if the barber has out uryhair aw·ry, or
if my vest is shubby while my tunic is flue: but graver inconsisteucies you core not
for. Iu respect of these you think I am but os med as my neighbours eud want uo
guardian, aud this though you ure my protector end are vertd with me for the
smellest neglect of my body, aud'though 1 look to you oud hung upon you like s
child.

(v. 106.) Iu short, to goboch. The wiceman is ouly inferiorto great Jove—rich, free,
respected, hnudsome, and e hiug of luinge, but above ull souud except when his
stomuch is out of order.
