EPISTOLARUM Ι. 111.

Panormus Agrippae Siculis quos colligis, Icci,
Si recte frueris, non est ut copia major

Ab Jove donari possit tibi. Tolle querelas;
Pauper enim non est cui rerum suppetit usus.
Si ventri bene, si lateri est pedibusque tuis, nil
Divitiae poterunt regales addere majus.

si ferte in medio positorum abstemius herbis
Vivis et urtica, sic vives protinus ut te
Confestim liquidus Fortunae rivus inauret3
Vel quia naturam mutare pecunia nescit,

' ’ Vel quia cuncta putas una virtute minora.
Miramur si Democriti pecus edit agellos
Cultaque dum peregre est animus sine corpore velox;
Cum tu inter scabiem tantam et contagia lucri
