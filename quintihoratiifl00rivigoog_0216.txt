HORATII FLAOCI

GARMEN XVI.

Horace here dwells ou his favour-ite theme—coutentment aud moderation,—which ιο
tsable ιο illustrate by the example of Maecenas ss well ae his own. The ingenuity which
has discovered the occasion thet gere rise ιο this ode will hardly throw any new light on
the meaning of it, which is very plain. Whether therefore Horace's friends hod urged
him ιο melre more than he herl done of his opportunities with Maecenas for the purpose
of enriching himself or not may very well remsiu doubtful. lcoufess the idea would not
have occurred ιο me. 'lhe lhench editors suppose it ιο bean ode of thenhs to Maecenas
for the gift of the farm, which it certainly is not; and cue editor, J. u. Schmid, suspects
Horace meant gently ιο hiut ιο his patron that he should ιο glad of an extensior of his
liberality‚ a species of erponi« which it is ιο ιο hoped does not represent the principles
of the person who suggests this ιοιίοιι. Τιοιο is uo clue ιο the dete of the ode further

1. Inclusam Deme] The story of “lhistes excubiae' is like Ovid'r ‘tristis
Danae, Acrisius' daughter, and the fable comedia servi’ (Δ. Δ. iii. 601). On the
of the shower of gold, ure explained hy tense ‘munierant’ see C. ii. 17. aen.
Horace in his own way. Compare the 6. thrtodsm pauidum] Acrisius shut up
