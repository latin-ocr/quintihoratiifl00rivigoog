ARGUMENT.

Yeu love the town, Fuscum I lore the country: that is our only difference. l for my
part begin then 10 live and 1ο be 1 king when l lly from all you praise so wurmly.
1 am like tlre slave who ran away from his master the priest, because he got nothing
but sweet sake 10 eat. 1 want something wholesome. Ifwe are tolive naturally,
where can we build our house more fitly than in the country? Wherc shall we lind
such wnrmth in winter, such coolbrcczes in summer? Whereis slcep so unbrokeu
by care? Is the mcedow less bright and swect than the marble lloor? Is the water
that struggles through theleaden pipo more pure than the rippling brook? Why even
among your pillars you grew asham forest, and you like no house like that which
has a landscape spread before it. You cannot get rid 01 Nature: she will come back
ancl essert her rights.
