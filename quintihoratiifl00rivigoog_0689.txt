EPISTLE Ι.

, 1110110 other anecdotos connected with Augustus, Suetonius, in his 1110 01 Horace, says,

“Post Sermones quoqne lectos, nullam sui mentionem habitem ita est questus = ‘Irasci
me tibi scite, quod non in plerisque ejusmodi scriptis mecum petierimum loquaris. An
vereris ne apud posteros tibi infame sit, quod videaris familiaris nobis esse i’ Expres-
sitqne elogium, cujus initium est, ‘Cum tot sustineas‚’ ’⁹ 110. Porphyrion, upon Epp.
i. 20, init„ has 71111 note ε ‘⁸ 111 his versibus et in principio sequentis libri apparet
Horatius hoc volumen quasi novissimum totins operis habuisse. Nem secundum episto-
larum mactus adjecit ;” and 17 the beginning 01 this Epistle he says: “Apparet hunc

= librum, utsupra diximus, hortatu Cnesnris scriptum esser cujus rei etiam Suetonius

auctor est.'’ This Scholiast's authority therefore was probably 110 other than that
which we possess in the above memoir, which us early at least 11 his day 1111 attributed

toSuetonius. But there is 110 improbability 1117110 story. Aaimilnr theory has besu
advanced in respect to the sixth Ode 01 the 11117 book, 1111111101 70 Agrippa, which,

, like this Epistle, deprecates the tash 01 attempting the praises 01 1 great tuan. Assu-

ming the truth 01 Suetonius’ statement, we must place the date 01 this Epistle alter

, the publication 01 the 11117 book. Itisgenerully supposed. with some probability, that

the Secular Ode wesin Horace's mind when he wrote 1. 132 sq. 11 10, the Epistle
was not written till aner 1170. 737. Beyond this there are no sale deta 101· fixingthe
time 01 composition. [Ritter concludes that this Epistle was begun at the end 01
1110742, and sent 70 Augustus about the end 01 743. The foundation 01 his urgu-
ment is v. 16, ‘ jurandasque tuum per numen,’ as he reads 71117 lino ; and 11111111 the
date 01 the 11711 01 Augustus at Lugdunum in nuc. 742 0111012. Suetonius
(Claud. 2) says that the 11711· was dedicated on the 11117 01 August 1.(1. 10, on the
birth-day 01 Claudius, who was born at Lugdunum. Dion 01111111 (541 0. 87) speaks
01 7101117111117 the altar 01 Lugdunum 11 existing iu ao. 12, aud he does 1107 spealr
01 the 11711 being then dedicated. We should rather 11101· hcm him that it was dedi·
cated before lac. 12. Livy’s Epitome 137 places the dedication aiter the disturbanca
in Gallie on account 01 the census, aud this appears to be in 1.(1. la. ulinton suggests
that Suetonius means the anniuersnry 01 the dedication; but that ia certainly not the
meaning 01 his words] “

71171101 the ebore story) hythe greum labours and anxieties 01 Augustus, on whose
attention it was not for him to intrude. He goes ou to commend the discriminatiou

envyand abuse when 11110 11111117111101011101111101171101111111111,11111 recognized
