xxiv INTRODUC'I'ION.

as it would esem, the sixth Satira of the second book, which book
therefore was not probably publiehed till ιιο end of 724 or the beginning
of the next year, when Horace was about thirty-five years old.

When Augustus returned from Asia, in nuo. 725, and closed the
gates of Janus, being the acknowledged head of the republie Horace
appeared amongst his most hesrty adherente. He wrote on this occasion
one of his beet Odee (i. 2), and employed his pen in forwarding those
reforma which it was the first object. of Augustus to effect. (See Intro-
duction ιο O. ii 15). His most striking Odes appear for the most part
. to have been written after the establishment of peace Some may have
been written before, and probably were. But for some reason it would
seem that he gave himself more ιο lyric poctry atter his thirty-fifth year
than he had done before. Ηο had most likely studied the Greek poete
while he was at Athene, and some of his imitatione may have been
written early. If so, they were most probably improved and polished
from time ιο time (for he must have had them by him, known perhaps
only to a few friends, for many years) till they became the graceful
epeoimene of artificial composition that they are. Horace continued ιο
employ himself in thie kind of writing (on a variety of subjecte, oon·
vivial, amatory, political, mora13 some original, many no doubt suggested
by Greek posms) till aruo. 730, when Ι am inclined to think the first
three booke of the Odee were publiehed. Ioannot here discues the
subject, but I have considered and stated in the case of each Ode the
evidences, if any, that it contains of its date, and 1 can find none which
may not ιο placed iu thet year or before it. Bentley’s theory, which
limite Horace ιο one species of composition at a time, and supposes each
of the first three books of Odee to have been publiehed separately, Ihave
no faith in 3 and he overlooks the fact that the twenty-fourth Ode of the
first book was certainly written four years after that in which ιο places
the publication of that book. Olinton, who supports Bentley (Faet. Hell.
rao. 38), can only do so by suppoeing that in the present copies some
pisces may have been transposed, which is begging the question.
Franks hee arrived, ae far as Ι can judge, attho right conclusion upon
thie subject. During this period Horace appears ιο have passed hie
time at Rome among the most distinguished men of the day, or at his
house in the country, paying occasional visite ιο Tibur, Praeneste,
and Baiae, with indifferent health, which required change of air.
About tho year nuo. 728 he was nearly killed by the falling of a
trce, on his own estate, which accident he hae recorded in one of his
Odes (ii. 13), and occasionally refers to. In the sarno stanzahe refers ιο
a storm iu which hewse nearly lost off Cape Palinurusl, on ibe west
