SATIRE IV.

Here again Horace is st palus ιο defend himself thom the charge of malevoleuee.
That this charge was loudly brought against him is clssr3 and the seoorrd Satira of
this book may have gone ι long way towards making him ausmies. Buthe must liare
written many more pisces than that, for ha speaks of ‘inea scripta' (v. 28), ‘meos
libellos’ (v. 71). Itis probahis his other Satires were in the sanm stmin ss the second,
which appears ιο have been puhliahed as a specimen of the style he here defends, hut
which ha thought iit ιο shandon, for there are uo other Satires of that kind. Inde-
pendent cf the above, Horace here shows something of an suthor's soreness ἰι respect
to the neglect his poema had met with, compared with others which he believed tc have
less merit 3 end though he attributes it entirely to the jealousy and fears of the multi-

tude, every man apprehending that he may ba attacked next, it is clear that ιο puts it
down in some measrue to a false tsste‘whieh preferred a wordy flowing style ιο ιιο
tarsenses sud accuracy of hir own. 'l'he poems of Lucilius were popular in spite of tha

looseuess of their composition and many defecta, which adcpraved teste had coms ιο
regardasmerits. (See note ou v. 6.) The virulence of Lucilius¹s Satiresdid not effect
Horace's generatim, who could alfard ιο admira them, hut had ιο liking for verses that
cume home to themselves. Horace hegen his career as ι satirical writer with Lucilius
for his model, aud the second Satira is s specimen of the style resulting from that
imitation. lt sat unesaily upon him. Lucilius he found, with all his power and his
merita, was not the model for him, and he was probably ιιιιιοι with coming short of
the vigour of his original, and this perhaps hythe persons who were londest in charging
him with a malignant temper. He had therefore ιο set himself right in respect ιο
Lucilius, and this he does both here aud elsewhere (S. leand ii. l) with much good
temper, candour, aud forbearance. He has also ιο contrast his own protensians with
those of the Crispini aud Fannii of the day, as well aa ιο quiet the apprehensione
of his friends, and disarm the malignity of his enemies, ιιι these ure the objecta
of the Satira. Evsry body must admira ιιο way iu which he takes occasion, from the
necessity of sslf-defense, to pay atributa of grateful affection ιο his fathsr's memory,
and it would he difficolt ιο ιιι a more pleasing picture of pstcmal solicitude and souud
sense, as applied ιο a hoy’s οιιοιιίοι, than Horace has drawn in the latter part of this
Sotira.

About· the date, l'ranke says it must have been written before nmo. 716, when
Asinius Pollio first introduced the practice of regular recitatione of their works hy
autlrors. lle says Horace would not have ιιοιιοι the reciters so contemptuonaly if
their practice had come into faahiou through the example of his friend Pollio. As 1
have said οι v. 78, 1 do not think the practice alluded to by Horace has any thing ιο
ιο with Pollio's practice ς ιιι es ιο Fannius’ books and huet having heeu deposited, aa
some leave said, in ιιο library built hy this same Pollio in amc. 715, there is not the
remotest reason ιο believe it. Franks says Horace could not ιι thia time have been οι
good terma with Augustus, orhe would not lrave mentioned “ acerba irrisione” Petillios
Capitolinus (94 sqq.), who wss afriend cf his. But the only bitterness in Horace's
worda is iu the sncer which hs puts into the mouth of Petillius' friend aud condemur.
lu short, the Satira appears to me ιο contein ιο clue to the dnta3 but it certainly eon·
cerne Horace's early reputation, ιιι so must he placed early, sud not very long aster
8. 2, which he quotes in v. 92.
