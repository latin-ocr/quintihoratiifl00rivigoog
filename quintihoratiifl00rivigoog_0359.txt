SATIRE I.

Τιιιι prosc-seed purpose oi* this Satire, or thet with which Horace seems tc have hegen,
may bs gethered from the first two lines. Discentant with the condition that Provi-
dence hus assigned them disappointment with the position msny yeors' labour- and
perhaps dishonesty have gained them; envy of their neighbours’ circumstances, even if
they ure worse thau their own ; dissutisi'action in short with what they heve and ere, aud
crawing for something they have not sud ore not-these arc features common to the
great majority oi meu. For this vice of discontcnt the Greeks had the comprehensive
name μεμψιμοιρία. lt ad'orda s wide field for antire, and could only hc touched lightly,
or in one or two of its many parts, in the compsss of one short poem. lt will be seen
that aster propounding the whole subject in the ehape ot' s question to Maecenas,
Horace confines himself to oue solution of it, and that, it must be admitted, nottho
must comprehensive (see notes ou vv. 28, 108). Nor has he managed the connexion
between his question and the only answer he gives it with very great alrill. Arariceis
tha only reason he assigna for the universal dieease, sud any one will ses that hereby
ha leores many untouched who ure as culpably restlcsa aa the esuritione, but not iu
their sordid way. However, when he is upon this subject he writes, as he almost
always does, with eleganca and truth, ond this is among the most populur oi Horsce’s
Satires. .
The chronolofflsts extract a date t'rom the verses 114, 115:

‘¹ Ut, quum carceribus missos rapit ungula curma,
Instat equis auriga suos ducentibus, -—''

which are s little lilre the laet three verses iu the first Georgic of Vir-gil:

“Utcumcaroenhussesesffuderequodrigso,
Addunt in spotia, et frustra retinacula tmdens
Fertur equis auriga, noque audit currus hebenus?

'lhese verses lior-sce ia said to hore imitatedz and as this Georgic is supposed by some
writers tc have been publishcd auo. 719, the Sutire could not have been written before
that year. But aven if719 be correctly assigned aa tho date of the drst Georgic, which
thare ara uo sufficient arguments to prove, it ia not at all impossible that the sbova
verses are imitated by both poete nom some common original, as Orelli suggests. 'lhe
lilrcnoss is not t.

'l'ho Satira isglpllt iirst in the order of this book, not aa au introductiou as some say
(of whidr it bears no signs), but becsrm it isaeuddressed to Maecenas.
