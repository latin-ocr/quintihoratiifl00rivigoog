230 HORATII FLACCI

Cum laude victorem geretque
Proelia conjugibus loquenda.
Karthagini jam non ego nuntios
Mittam superbos: oceidit, occidit 70
Spes omnis et fortuna nostri
Nominis Hasdrubale interempto.
Nil Claudiae non perficient manus,
Quae et benigno numine J uppiter
Defendit et curae sagaces 75
Expediunt per acuta belli.

Emperor’s protracted absence we munet tell, but we need not on that account gire eredit

which beare much more the impreseiou of real feeling thau of flattery‚ represented the
sentimenta of great numbers at Rome, who felt the want of that presiding genius which
had brought the city through ita lang troubles aad'given it comparative peace. There

influence of ona mind than ie represented in thir ode, if we except that with which no
merely mortnl language ean compare (Isaiah xi. and lxv. hlieah iu). 'l'he cannen
Saeculare contains much that is repeated here. Virgil’e description in his fourth
Eelogue will naturally occur ιο the reader.
