EPISTLE Π.

Something hes been said about Μ. Lollius, ιιι consul, who was defeated by the
Sigambri, in the Introduction to C. iv. 9, which ode was addresaed ιο him probably on
the occasion ol his defeat, some time atter the waiting of this lipistle ιο his cldeat son,
as ιιι person here addressed is generally supposed ιο ba. The eightecntb lalpistle is
written to the ιιιιι person. 'lhere we leam that Lollius was with Augustam in tha
Cantabrian expedition, ιιι. 729, and that ιι ιιι ι brother, to whom some suppose
tha eightceuth lipistlc was written. lt is plain that the person here addreaaed was
young, and if ιι had been with ιιι army, he was now practising ior the Forum.
Horace addresaes him ιι ‘paen’ and speaks of his declaiming α is he were still with
the rhetorical toacher3 ιιι these toacher-s attendcd young men at home aster they ιιι
len school aud taught them the higher principles oi cratory. ‘Puer’ is a word that
might be used familiarly towards a young man long past ‘pueritia’ and, aa anke
observes, it ia not likely that these grave views oi life would be addressed tc a boy who
had not yet ιιιιι ιιι ‘toga virilis? Ithiuk there is much probability in ιιι date
l'ranlre supposes, nuc. 781, which would be a year aiter Lollins’ return frum Spain
while he might yet bs quite young: though when Franks supporta his opinion by the
reference in v. 5³ ιο gout und fomentatione, he only wealrcns his argument (see note).
Why Lollius is called Maximus iu the first verae no one ιιι yet satisfactorily shown.
Τιιι ιι was the elder of two brothers, supposing that ιο have been the mse, would be
abad reason ior calling him blasianus. He would rather be called Major. But this ia
ιιι opinion of some editors, ond of Orelli among them. Τιιι he had the cognomen
Maximus is the explanation oi others. [Kriiger affirma, on ιιι authority ci Gruter
638. 2, ιιιι Maximus is ι cognomen ol the Gens Iollia ; and ιι compares ‘Maxima
Lolli'with ‘Crispe Saliusti,' C. ii. 2. 3, ‘Hirpine Quinti? 0. ii. 11. 2.] Βιι thereia
no trace oi such a cognomen in this family: the only cognomen they are known to
have borne during the republic is Palicanus, ιιι ιιι father of this youth does not
appear ιο have ιιι any. Yonng Lollius could not have done any thing to gain himself
such a titles and on tha whole l am inclined ιο ιιὶιι ιιι word is only a familiar hali
jocnlar way of addressing his young friend that Horace uses, as in the other Epistle
he addresees him as ‘liberrime Lolli! Isca ιο other way of explaining the word,
which Ειιιι gives up as unintelligible. [Ritter ιιι discovered the secret. 'ihc lollius

whom Horace addresses is ιι. Lollius, consul nmo. 733, ιιι this Epistle was written ἶ

in hie consulship.

Horace hus bein refreshing himself with the cccl breeaea of Praeneste, and reading
llomcr over again, and ιιι been more than ever impressed, as it would ιιιιι, with the
