38 HORATII FLACCI

non, whom Lambinus follows, supposes Horace is addressing himself ιο ιιο fears cf
Brutus, and dissuading him from renewing the battle at Philippi, atter the death of

Cassius—a strange time for erting verses after the manner of Alcaeus, and an unusual
way for a military tribune ιο offer counsel ιο his commender-in-cbief. Acron supposes
Horace ιο ιο alluding to the designa of the republican party, under Sextus Pompeius.
'lhis opinion is supported at some length by Buttmann, Mythol. i. 343 sq, who unguen

that the ship does not siguify ιιο commonwealth, for that Horace speaks ss if ιο were
separated from ιιο subject of the allegcry: that to advisa the citizens ιο abstain from
civil wara (represented by the sea), because they were in a cripplsd condition, would be ιο
imply that they might engage in them if they were not in that condition; also thatthere
would be no propriety in representing the stata as a diamasted ship in ιιο time of Augus-
tus. He therefore considers that all this refers ιο ιιο efforts of the broken but restless
party ιο which Horace bad been lately attached torepair their fortunas under the leading
of Sext. Pompeius. ‘Nudum remigio latus,’ he says,refers ιο ιιο numberoftheirbest men
cut off at and since Philippi (he might have addedthe desertina of Menas). 'l'he ‘desi-
derinm,' spoken of in v. 18, means ιιο lingering affection aad anxiety Horace had for the
party ιο bad first cast in his fortunas with, and ‘taedium' the vesatica ιο had suffered
in common with Brutus and all his best officere at the state of the republican forces ιι
Philippi. ‘Pontica pinus' he consideres very masterly allusion ιο Pompey the Great, as
ιιο conqueror of Mithridates, wbicb is Acron's opinion. 1 gire this theory iu deferencc
ιο ιιο author, who has few equale in critical sagacity, and who in the essay in which
these views are put forward has done good service tothe interpretation of Horace on ιιο
principles cf common sense. Ishould mention however that the theory has but few
supportem, cf whom Gesner certainly is one, and his was no mean judgment. Passow
is another. Franks cannot sufficieutly express his astonishment at Buttmann’s strange
doctrine. Having made up his mind that none cf the odes in these three books were
written before Actium, auo. 723, ιο adopts the opinion cf Torrentius, Messon, Sana-
don, and others, that Horace wrote this ode at ιιο time when Augustus was thinking of
retiring from ιιο head of affairs (amc. 725), and when he was dissuaded by Maecenas
in a speech in which he likened the state tc a vessel test upon ιιο waters withouta pilot
(Dion Cass. 52. 16). It does not seem ιο have occurred ιο Franks, that suppcsing the
historiam ιο have related the actrral words of Maecenas, which is somewhat improbable,
it is as likely he got his image from Horace as Horace from Maecenas. But tbe image
was common and always will be, end it is as plain as possible that Horace gothis
notion not from Maeeenasbut from Alcaeus. Besides, the cantione contained iu this ode
are plainly addressed, not ιο Angustus, bat ιο ιιο citizens, and sc far from requiring such
cautious, they were importunate in requesting him to remain as he was.

Hirchner, who speaks of Buttmann’s opinion as ‘infelicissima’ has no hesitation in
referring the ode, with Epod. vii, ιο ιιο year before the battle of Actium, when the
flames cf war were kindling again between Augustus and Antonius. Juni, Mitsch„
Doering are of the same opinion, and Dillenbr. rather prefers ιι. Orelli is silent.

Having now stated all the opinions that 1 have scen upon this much-disputed ode,
Imust leave the reader ιο jndge for himself. That there was many an honr when
Horace sighed for peace between the day hc found himself established in his scribe's
office ιο that which brought Augustus home in triumph is certain, and that he felt ss a
man cf weak nerves might feel in a sturm during ιιο troubles of that long period may

ι well be supposed. 1 think it is very hard to say st what precise junctura in tbcse stining

times the action entered his head cf sitting down ιο write sn ode in close imitation of
Alcaeus, though we may safely affirm, that the idea would only be natural while Rome
was disturbed, and therefore that ιιο cde was written ιοιοιο ιιο death of M. Antonius
in anm. 724. Of the theories above gisen 1 prefer Acrouh.
