EPIS'lOLARUM 11.1. 667

ingeniis non ille levet plauditque sepultis,

Nostra sed impugnet, nos nostreque lividus odit.
Quod si tum Graecis novitas invise fuisset

Quem nobis, quid nunc esset retus? sut quid baberet
Quod legeret tereretque viritim publicus usus?

Ut primum positis nugari Graecia bellis

Coepit et in vitium fortune labier seque,

Nunc athletarum studiis, nunc arsit equorum,
Marmoris sut eboris fabros aut aeris emovit,
Suspendit picta uultum mentemque tubelle,

Nunc tibicinibus, nune est gavise tmgoedis ,·

Sub nutrice puella velut si luderet iniens,

Quod cupide petiit metune plens reliquit.

Quid plncet sut odio est quod non mutabile eredas?
Hoc paces habuere bonae ventique secundi.

Rornae dulce diu fuit et sollemne reclusa
