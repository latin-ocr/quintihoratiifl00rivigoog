aa · ιιοιιιιιι nnncor

It has been conjectured with probability, and ιι ιι confirmedbya Scholium, that this
ode was written soon after tho battle of Aetium, when Agrippa'a glory was at its height.
Ιι would seem that the general had asked Horace to writean ode inhis honour; hut he
had the good sense to decline a taalr which ιι might not have exeouted satisfactorily to
the great man or himself: at tho same time he declined in the most gracefnl way by
intimating that Agrippa desemed ιιι Ilpic rather than an odc, and the pen of Varius
rather than of Horace. As ιο this L. Varius Rufus, see S. i. 5. 40 ιι.

ARGUMENT.

Varius shall sing in Homeric atrsin of thy victoriae by ses and land. lfy humblc muse
dures not sing of these, of the wrath ofAchilles, or the wanderings of [nyssae. or ιιι
fate of Pelops' house, nor will she disparage thy glories and omaro. Who can litly
sing of Mars mall-clad, of Meriones blaclr with the dnst of Troy, of Diomed a match
for godel I sing but of feasts and cf the battles of boys and girls.
