EPODON LIBER, 4. 281

ΟΑΒΜΕΝ IV.

nn the positive informatiou ve can darive hom this ode iu respect to the purport and
date is, that it contains 0 vehement invective against some person 01 low birth aud con·
temptible character, who gave himself ains, aud 0130100110 people of Bomer he was
also 0 military tribune. The approximate tirneis tired hythe lact linee, which show
that it was written while Caesar 0010010000 was preperiug or carrying on war against
Sextus Pompeius, who had enlirted in 1ι1ι service pirates aud slaves, esve learn from
Dion (49. o 1-12. See below, 1010). 'l'o bring οι nearer tothe 0100101010, 11 hes been
argued (first hy Elasson 10 110 life 01 Horace) that, ineamuch 00 10 110 second expedition
01 Cesar against Ser. Pompeiae there were enlisted iu 11011001 ιι great body of slaves, it
10 uot probable 1101 Horace would have used languegeof contempt which would epply aa
urach to Caesar’a ac the enemy's force. lt must therefore have heeu written, if this
assumption haseuy weight, before 1101 armameut was formed, which was nno. 717. 10

15 0.), and it was iu consequence 01 110 advantage gained by this 000ιί defection that
Caesar declared war against Pompeius, in which war he 0001010οά two severe detentu
aster which he suspended operatione for 0 twelvemouth, and during that period it 1ι naid
with coufideuce this Epode was written. lt is aleo stated by 011110 Scholiasta 11011100οι
10110 subject 011110 lampeon. 'fhe greateraumber ofrnoderu critice (10011 their accamry,
end as the uame ‘Vedius Rufus ’ occurs iu oue or two inscriptions, that name has been
tired upou instead 01 ‘hienae’ though no attempt is made to identify him with any his-
torical character. 'lhe objectione raised 10110000 being the perron alludedtoare ι 1. 'l'het
Horace would not heve failed to notice the trerchery ee well as the pride 01 this person.
But that argument, which is Geener'e, hae uo great force. Horace meant to ettack the
swrggeriug aire of the meu, which were more offensive to the citizens thau his betrayal
of Pompeius, by which they had gained, and which could not have been noticed without
etl'eudiug Caesar. 2. (that Menae had been eo short a time iu Rome, 1101 10 could not

length of time war wanted for theee objecta. 'He had no doubt made himself rich before
Ι 10 betrayed his trust, having had plenty of opportunitiee 1οι· doing so, and probably he

did uot sell his conscience aud his trust for nothing. lle had had time to invest his
money, 10000ιο 0 favoured guest of Caesar, aud have his head turned; and every few
exhibitione of himself iu the character here described wouldbe enough 10 call forth this

short lampoou. 01101 Menas was not an eques. But 10 ιιοι elevated to that rank by
(100001, ιι we leam nom Dion (xlviii. 45) 3 aud at any rate, if he had bnt the regulatcd

theatra 4. It isatlirmed that Menas could uotbe calleda ‘tribunus rnilitum,' inesmuch as

hewhohad been under Pompeiae the governor oftwo large islanda (Sardinia aud Corsica),
aa well as admiral of his fleet and commender of three legions, would have held a higher
poet under (100001, who had received and continued to treet him with great respect.

, But it ie a matter of history that Meuae' deeertion of Crem sud return 10 his old

master arose 001 01 110 discouteut with the rank given him hy 110 former, eud it is hard
to ray what that rank may at any given time have 1000. 11 was always subordinate3
and, though we leern he rose to be legatus to Calvisius Sabinus the chief admiral, he
may 01 tlrst only have been a military tribune, which post however would 01 once give
him equestrian rank (S. i. 6. 25 0.). 1. 11 is said wc do not know that Menae ever
