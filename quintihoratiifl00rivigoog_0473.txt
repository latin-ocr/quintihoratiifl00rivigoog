SATIRH Ι.

C. hennum 'essm was a jurisconsult of emiuence and a man of honour. [He was
intimate with Cicero, who wrote for him a letter of recommendation ιο C. Caesar during
the Gallio war, and corresponded with Trebatius while he was with Caesar in Gallia
(ad Fam. vii. 5—18).] He was also in the confidence of Augustae who consulted him
on legal matters [Dig. i. 2. 2 5 45 ι lust. ii. 25.] Horace seems to hare been well ac-
quainted with him, though he was many years younger than hebetius, and it is said
that he was dead when this Satira was written. I am inclined to doubt this, for
though it is possible Horace may have used the old man's name even if he was dead, it
ismore natural to suppose that he did so when he was alive. The Satira is phaed by
some chronologists after all the othere of the mccnd book. Franks argues from the
allusion in r. 15 to the Parthians, that it must have been written iu ame. 724, when,
after the battle of Actium, Augustus was in Asia settling the affairs of the Hast (O. i.
26, Ine). I think thia is a weak foundation for hie assumption. AsI have said before,
the conquest of the Parthians was a subject the Romans of this period had continually
before them, and to allude to the wonnds of the Parthian prostrate on the field of
battle (¹‘aut labentis equo describat vulnere Parthi '') would have been more natural
at almost any time than when Angustus was carrying on peaceful negotiatione with
that people, without any immediate intention or prospect os coming to blows with
them. 'enat the Satira was written after the eightb ol the first book isplain, because
a verse is repeated from that Satira in this (r. 22). Horace writes however as if he
were just beginning hia career (r. 60), full of the impulsas ol youth, and resisting
the superior wisdom of bis elder. Aa thiais done only ιο keep up a little humour
in the scene, uo particular inference as to time can be drawn hom it. Because
Caesar is called ‘invictus' (v. 11), Kirchner supposes tha Satira could not have been
written till after the death of M. Antonius and the linai establishment of Angustua'
power. He therefore ewumes the date aue. 726, which 1 believe to be much too
lata. ' ’

Horace pretends ιο lay before the old lawyer a case for his opinion, and aske what
he had better do ιο meet tbe malevolence of his enemies. Trebatius advises him to
caasa from writing, which Horace says ia impossible. He was born to write, and must
do it. He has no capacity for heroic subjeets, and has a passion for imitating Lucilius,
ιο whom he pays a graesful compliment by the wey. Trebatius warns him that he
runs the risle of being frozen to death hy his great friends, or of legal penalties for

libel. But trusting in the goodness of his cause Horace sets these dangers ardenense,
and resolves to indulge his inclination. Ιι isnot easy to suppose that a satire written
in this sti-uin aas quite the last that Horace compcsed; and it might he supposed, not
