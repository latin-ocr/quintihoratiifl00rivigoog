442 HORATII FLACCI

Sive quod Apula gens seu quod Lucania bellum

Incuteret violenta. Sed hie stilus haud petet ultro
’ Quemquam animantem et me veluti custodiet ensis

Vagina tectus3 quem cur distringere coner

Tutus ab infestis latronibus? Ο pater et rex

Nec quisquam noceat cupido mihi pacis! At ille

Qui me commorit-melius non tangere! clamo;

Flebit et insignis tota cantabitur urbe.

Cervius iratus leges minitatur et urnam,

Canidia Albuci quibus est inimica venenum,

Grande malum liuius, si quid se judice certes.
