HORATII FLACCI

OARMEN XII.

auc. lto—729.

Marcellus married J ulia, the daughter of Augustus, ano. 729, aud died tel. Tire
allusion iu v. 46 of this ode makes it quite certain that it was written before the death
of Marcellus, nud after he had attsiued au age iu which be could give promise of sus-
taining the distinction of his name. The meaning of that stam is plainly this: “ Tha
fame of the house of Marcellus, taking its birth from the great Claudius the victor of
Syracuse, is growing up through successise generations like the insensible gmwth of a
trec, and promises ιο corneto maturity in Octavia's son.” Franks thinks the ode was
written before Augustus went against the Cantabricus in 729, and about the time of
Marcellus’ marriage, when he was only in his eighteenth year. Others place it after
Augustns’ return from Spain iu hmo. 730, and the closing of the temple of Janus. Ι
-think with Franks some allusion to this esent would bars been made had theodo ιοοο
written then. Torrentius thinks it was one of those hymns which by order of the Senatu

(according ιο Dion Cassius) were addresscd ιο Augustus, as s god, after the battle of l

actium. At that time Marcellus was in his fourtsenth year, but even then Augustus
was very fond of him and had great hopes of him. The poem has much of the appear-
ance of au ode for music, but shymn composed on the occasion Torrentius supposes
could hardly hare failed toallnde to the successes it was intendedto celebrate. 1 prefer
Tranke's opinion ιο ιιο οιιοτο,· but there is no possibility in my judgment of flxingthc
date precisely. ann. 729 appears ιο ιο ιιο latest year to which it can be properly
assigned, and 725 'the earliest.
The opening is taken from tha second Olympic ode of Pindar, which begins-
’ ἀναξιφόρμιγγες ὕμνοι

, τινα θοόν, τίν’ ἥρωα, τινα δ’ llrdpn κελαδήσομεν.1

But ιιο rest of the ode seems to be original. Pinder aska whom he shall sing, and
immediately siugs of Theron. Horace, though he makes Angustus the climax of his
song, goes through the prsises of J ore and his children, and then of twelve of Rornc’s
principal worthies, before he comes ιο Augustus. Tha common inscriptions, therefore,
“an Ancusroa,” or “ns Auonsro,’' do not seem ιο expreesthe scope of this ode,
which is rather ιο celebrate the populor divinities eud heroes of Rome than Augentus
exclusiraly y though this design is so worked out as to draw the chief attention tobim.

ARGUMENT.

thm wilt tho'u sing among gods or men, Oiioi’ Whosc name shall the echoes of
Helicon or Fundus repeat, or of Haemus whose woods followed the sweet music of
Orpheus? thm before the almighty Tather, who knows nc equsl or seooudi After
him corneth Palles sud then breve Liber, aud the huntress Diana, and Phoebus the
archer, and Hercules and Lsda’s sons, ιιο hersemar and tha fighter, before whose ι
star the tempests fly. Thcu shall it be Romulus, or the peaceful Numa, or proud -
Tarquin, or Cato that nobly died? Regulus, and the Scauri, and Paulus, who gava
up his great sonl to the Carthaginien gratefully, 1 will sing, aud Fabricius, unanrius,
arrd Camillus, all trained for war in porerty’s school. 'l'hcfsme of Marcellus is grow-
ing up insensibly like a tres, aad the star of J nlius is brightarthan all stara To thee,
great father. is given the care of Caesare share with lrirn thy kingdom. Putting
Parthians ιο fiight and snbduiug the natione of tha East, he shall rule the world es
thy vicegerent with a riglrtcons sway, while thou dost shake Olympus and hurlest
thy bolts upon the haunts of impiety.
