ΗΟΙιΑΤΙΙ FLACCI

OARMEN ΙΙ.

ane. 788.

'l'he lor-tunes oi Iulus Antonius, son of the triumvir hl. Antonius by his wiie Fulvia,
hia riso and tragical end, do not concern this ode. He wss amun οι· letters and spupil
of L. Crassitius, a grammarian who hept a sehool at Rome, to which many sons of the
noble familiea were sent. lle received therefore a good aduertion, and we have it· on tlre
authority ol the Scholiasta that he wrote au heroic poem on the fortunes of Diomedes in
twelve books, besides some prose worlrs. Acron says that hir poern was excellent ; but,
aa itis not likely he ever saw it, his testimony is not worth much. (See lleyne, Ere.
Aen x. 243.) Horace pays him the oornpliment of saying that he could celebrate
Augustus* victories much better than himself, but this he said to Maecenas (O. ii. 12.
11),· and, though fromthat passage and this we may believe thet Maecenas wrote prose
and Antonius poetry, the quality of either and the subjecta munet be inlerred from any
data Horace has given us. Because we know nothing os Antonius’ poetical powers ex·
cept from this ode, and because oi the distance between the trvonarnea, ‘Iule’ (v. 2) arrd
‘Antoni’ (r. 26), some critica have changed ‘Iule’ into ‘Ille’ (Peerlkamp. in loeo
Eichstadt. Paradox. Horati. p. 9), aud supposed ‘Antoni’ to mean Antonius Rufus,
whois mentioned by Acron (on Δ. Ρ. 289) and Comm. (iruq¹ aa one who wrote comedy;
but the existence oi such a person is very doubtful, though Suetonius mentions a gram·
marian oi that name, and Orid speaks oi one Rufus who wrote lyrio poetry aster the
manner of Pindar (lix Pont. iv. 16. 27 equi:

“ Et qui Maeoniam Phaeacida vertite et uua
Pindaricae iidioen tu quoqne, Rufe, lyrae.''

But there ia no reason to suppose hia name was Antonius. In ert-0. 788 the Sigambri,
with two other German tribes, crossed the Rhirre and laid waste part of the Roman
territory in Gaul. They defeated the legrte Lollius, arrd thie disuter was sufficient to
induce Augustus (Dion Cass, 54. c. 19, intimetes that he had other ressone, especially
his personil unpopulsrity at Rome and his intrignes with Terentia, which ia mere
gossip) to go in person to Gaul, which he did, end ut hia approach the Germane with·
drew into their· own territorias, and giving hostages obtained peace. The defeat oi Lol·
lius had caused great consternation at Rome, and the news oi the barbariam' subjectior
was hailed with proportionate joy. Augustus did not return for two years to Rome,
having meanwhile restored order in Germsny, Gaul, and Spain ς bnt it is probuhle this
ode was written in the expectation of his return, end while the news respecting the
Sigambri was still fresh, that is to say, about the audetisne. 738. Augustus’ return
to Rome was expected long before it took placo (sea C. 5 of this bools). The gener-sl
impr-esaion derived from the ode ia that Antonius had pressed Horace to write a poem in
honour of Augustns’ victory in tlre style ol lindar's ἐποίκια, and that he very wisely
declinet, though his friend 'litius (hipp. i. 3. 10) was more bold, and Rufus above men·
tioned vas so too.

Autumnus.

Whoso would riral Pindar· must expect Icarns' fate. His numbers roll lilre aswollen
river. ilis is the hay, whether he tune the dithyramb or sing of gods and heroes, of
victora or of women bereaved. The swan of Dirce soars to the clouds: Iam but ιι a
beo sipping the flowers of Tibur. Thou, Antonius, ahalt sing of the triumphs of
Caesar, greatest end best, and of the holiday rejoicings that hail his return: and Ι
will edd my small voice to thirre: and we will all sing aonga of triumph and will
sacrifice, thou with bulls and corve, l with a young heller.
