CARMINUM 1. 30, 31. 69

OARMEN XXXI.

In huc. 726 (aeth October), Angustus dedicated a temple with a library attached,
which he had built in honour oi Apollo, cn the Palatina hill, to commemorate hia vic·
torp at Actium (Suet. Octav. 29, Dion Cass. liii. 1). After the ceremoniae of the dayes
dedication were orer, we may suppose Horace putting in his own claim tutha god's
favour in this ode, in which he represents himself as offer-ing a libation (whether in
private or at the templa ia uncertain), and asking for that which according to Juvenal
(ι. 356) should ba the eud of all prayer, ‘mens sana in corpore sano l'

marmana.

What salas the poet with his libation of Apollo? not cupa, cr herda, or gold and ivery,
or rich fields. Lei those who may prune Calenian vinea, and rich merchants drink
rich wine out of cupa cf gold, favourites of heaven, who tranem the deep in safety.
My leod is the olive, the chicory, and mallon. het me enjoy what 1 have, thou son
of laio, round in body and mind, and let my age pass with honour and tha lyce.
