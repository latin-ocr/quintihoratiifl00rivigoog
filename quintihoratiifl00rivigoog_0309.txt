EPODON LIBER, 2. 273

CARMEN ΙΙ.

Horace, meaning to write on the praises ef the country, put his poem (whether aa
an ulter-thought or not may be open ιο conjecture) into the ehape os a rhapsody by n
money-getting nsurer who, aster reciting the blessings ola country lile and sighing for
the enioyment ol thom, resolving to throw up his business and persuading himself that
ιο desires nothing so much as retirement and a humblo lile, finds habit too strong for
him and fulls back upon the sordid perenits which alter all are most congenial te him.
Some may perhaps think that this little bit of satire is the chief object for which the
poem was written. My impression is that it was commenced (whether in imitation of
virgil, Geor-g. ii. 458 sqq„ as l'rsnke supposes, or of a poem of Archilochus [Fr. 21.
Bergk] os lachmann, or not in imitation ol any thing, which is more proboble) as a
‘¹ laudatio vitae rusticae ” (which is the tenor of most of the inscriptions), and that the
last four remes, which have baeu called olnmsy, wore added ιο give the rest e moral.
At any rate the grentes· part of the speech must ιο admitted ιο ιο rather ont of keep·
ing with the supposed speaker. We should not expect, fer instance, ιο hear a city
muter talk about au hereditary sarm, the dangers ol the soldier and the seilor, and the
cares of love. The lest difficultyis got rid oi by Doen'ng and others. who interpret
‘omer' (v. 37) as the love ol money, which that editor says “vix dubitari potest,'’

though the word ‘habondi' “paule licentius omisit.'' Thisl am quitesureiswronffl, ¹

and 1 think we must allow that Horace was more intent upon his description than on
maintaining au coeunte consistency between the circumstances of the speaker and
the sentiments ιο attere. aut however this moy be, tho picture is very beautiful and
themora! vary truc. In the most 'sordid minda more genial impulsos will sometimes
ariae: bnt the beauties ol nature aud the cherms ol a peaceiul retirement ere, like
virtue itsclt', only attractive iu the dimisse and at interrels te minds thot have grown
sddioted ιο ιιο pnrsnit of gain l'or its own sake. To such minda domestic aud innocent
pleasnres effer no losting gratification, and the picture of rustic enjoyment on the oue
hand, and oi the jaded bnt still grnsping nsurer struggling for a moment οςοὶοοι his
propensities on tha other, affords o wholesome leasen sor many. In respect to the date,
it can only ιο conjectured that Horace had tested the enjoyments he describes so gra·
phically‚ and was in possession of his farm. But even thot is uncertain. Franks,
thinking that Horace must hare had before him Virgil’s second Georgic (458 sqq.),
which some ray was net pnblished till mun. 724, attributes thie ode to *124 niso, in
which his ffiend lachmann informs him he seems ‘¹ nimis subtiliter ignorabilia rimatus
esse.” 'lbere is a ingruent from the comedy Νῆσοι attributed ιο Aristophanes (344,
Diod), which is vary like this ode. Whether Horace ever saw it or thought of it when
he was writing, it is impossible te say. lt rens thas :-
