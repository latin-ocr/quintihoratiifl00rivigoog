Tunes is no sufficient internal evidence of the time when this poem was written or
of the persons 66 wlrorn it is addressed. They are three in number, a father and two
sens. Porphyrion end Corum. (666. say that the father is L. Calpurnius Piso Caeso·
uinus, who was Praefectus Urbi under 'liberius (Teo. hun. 6610). 16 this be so, as he
was born iu amc. 705, arrd hed ut this tirus a son verging at least on msnhood (for
66 66 other would this sort ot' instruction be addressedy see v. 866), 666 poerrr must
have been written very shortly before the death 66 Horace, ame. 746. Orelli and
Kirchner, and many others, taire this view of the date. Hstre‘, Franks, arrd many
before thern, put it earlier, and iu that case s diuersus Piso must be assumed. The
person supposed by 666 advocates of au earlier date is On. Calpurnius Piso, who
belonged to the party of Brutus and Cassius, and fought together with Horace at
· Philippi. He had a sorr who was consul 666. 747, aud if he 666 666 youth referred
to, the Ars Poetics must hare been written a good many years before. But the question
is one it is impossible te decide, eud nothing turns upon it for the understanding of the
poern, which, like many others, might 66 addressed to any body; though 1 do not agree
with those who suppose Horace had no particular persons in mind. Τ66 Pisones ebore
referred to are numbered 8, 22, 23, in 666 Dict. Biog.

As 66 666 purpose of the poem l heve tried to help the reader in judgiug for himself
by 6 careful division of the Argrrment. It will be seen thet the rules are miscellaneoue
and heve little or no method, and that 666 history 66 Peetry which Horace gives is
mere fsnciful than real. It is impossible 66 loolr upon it 66 6 finished poem. We are
carried from precept 66 history, and from one sort of poetry to another without
warning; sud though a general connexion may be traced between the principles 66666
lrind end those of another, 66 pains are taken to separate the rules that belongto each.
’666 rules and history of 666 Drama ure chiefly dwelt upon, with what particular
bearing upon Roman poetry it is not easy to see. Much that is 66ἱά can heve 66 refer·
enee to it at all, and could efford no instruction to a Roman. Τ66 observatione on
this subject are interrupted now sud then by irrelevant observatione, and 66 666 whole
there can be little doubt either that the Ars Poetics 666 published efter Horsce's
death, out 66 fragrnents clumsily put together, or 666666 published it himself iu this
carcless wey from that habitual indolence which presented his ever producing a com·
plete worlr of arry length, end which is seen in the abruptness with which several of
lris pieces are brought 66 a close. Atterupts lrave been suadete re-srrange the mate·
rials so as to form a perfect whole, but the rneaus of doing sc do not erist. Τ66 place
now insariebly assigned 66 666 Ars Poetica was flrst given it by H. Stephcns. In tlre
MSS. and earlier editions it is inserted before the Satires. Smne editors treat it as 6
