This poem had a plain purpose with which the ode before us has nothing in common.
Nevertheless it has besu generally supposed till of lete years to be an imitation of Stesi-
chorus,and some ofthcgrammarians have prefixed tothe odethetitle “Ad Ίιςοᾱιιιοειιι,υ
no doubt under the same impressiou. The foundation of this opinion appears to have
been the statement of Acron: “ Hanc oden in satisfactionem faoit anrieae suae, imitatus
Stesichorum politam Siculum qui vituperationem scribens Helenae caecatus est et postea
responso Apollinis leudem ejus scripsit et oculorum aspectum recepit.'’ He does not
therefore say that Horace imitated the ode of Stesichorus, bnt only his example. It is
very probable, es Buttmann suggests, they got the nome from the next ode and put it
before this, which contains no name nor a'ny clue to the person addressed. Some MSS.
have the inscription “Palinodia Gmtidise ad Tyndaridem,'’ and whoever invented this
inscription must have supposed the ode to have been sddreesed to the daughter of that
woman, whom he lampoons in his Epodes. Cruqnius' Scholiast offirma that it is ad-

, dressed to that person herself, and there ure many who follow this view of the case,

'among others Heindorf on S. i. 8. Franke is decidedly of that opinion, and supposes
this ode to have been written about the same time with llpod. xvii, end for the same
mock purpose. 1 think there ean be little doubt in the mind of any one who reads this
poem, that it was composed (though not in seriousness) with reference to soinc verses
. Horace had actually written, und that it is nota mere translation of Stesichorus' or any
other poem while at the same time there are Greek ideas in it, which he borrowed
from that or some other source, Beyond this I sm not bold enough to go.
