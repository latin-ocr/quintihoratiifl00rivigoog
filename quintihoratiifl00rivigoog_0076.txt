CARMEN XV.

'lhis is probably nb esrly composition of Horace, mede up of meterinls from the Greek,
end written merely ιο exercise his pen. The Scholiasta found ο politicel drusion in the
ode r Puris being Μ. Antonius, end Helen Cleopatra ς end Ruteni nueytmns, hes selred
upon the notior, which others nlse heve adopted. The judicious reeder will see thet
there is no probability of such being the drift of the ode. Nereus is mede to spesk be·
oense the ses-gods were endowed with the gift of prophecy. Porphyrion on this ode says
it is nn imitation of Bacchylides, who makes Cassandra foretell the destruction of Troy
es Honos does Nereus. There is s fragment (29 Bergk) which is supposed ιο belong
to the poem referred to by this Scholisst, but it beers no resemblance to Horroe’s ode.

ARGUMENT.

Psris is carrying off Helen, when Nereus oeuses e cslnr and thus prophesies their fste.
With dsrk omen ert thou carrying home her whom Greeco heth sworn to recover.
Ales! for the swesting of horse sud rider, end the desths thou ert bringing upon
Troy. Pelles prspereth her srms end her fury. Under Venus’ sheiter comb thy
looks end striks thy lyre, sud bide thyself in thy chumber: but it shall not eveil
thee. Seest thou not Laertes' sou, Nestor of Pylos, Teucer of Salamis, und Sthenelus
the tighter end bold cbnrioteer? Merion too end the son of Tydeus, from whom
thou shelt fiee pnnting es the stag fleeth frorn the wolf, thou who didst bonst better

things ιο thy fuir one. Achilles’ wrath msy put οι the evil duy, but the fre of the
Greek shsll consume the homes of They.
