Dices heu quotiens te speculo videris alterum:

Ques mens est hodie, cur eedem non puero fuit?
Vel cur his animis incolumes non redeunt genae?

CARMEN XI.

'lhere will be found in this end in the only other two Sopphic odes contained in this
boolr mors devictione, in the proportion os nearly four to one, from the ceesursl srrsnge-
ment observed in the flrst three books then in all the odes of those books put together.
From this and other internal evidence it hus been ergued thet this ode is s lste one, bnt
I think the arguments ure inconclusive. It is true thet Horace eddresses Phyllis ss his
lsst love, but not, so fer es 1 oen see, in the tone of s person now grown old, ns Butt-
rnsnn seyr. Most rnen wishing to pleese e woman vove constency ιο her, end one who
was obliged ιο confess theths hed been inconstent to others would only be the more ve·
hementin professing stedlcstness ιο her whom he desired lor the omesion ιο win. ButI
do not meon ιο express sny decided opinion one wsy or the other. lt is only importent
to hedrin mind thst this boolr wer published, not to revive Horace’s reputetion cs s
writer of smstory verses, but st the desire oi the emperor, who wished tbe pruises of his
stepsons to be sent forth to the world, end his own with them. Theodoto Lyde, on
the day of the Neptunalia (C. iii. 28), is like this end hes more spirit. It is not im·
possible Horsce may hsve written this es eerly es the other, but thought the other
better, end thet oneof the kind ves enough ior publication. The form ‘spargier’ which
occurs nowhere elseiu the odes, gives this the sppcsrnnce ol e different style οι·
composition from others ς but whether this is due to design or carelessness, or ιο its
being en eerly or Iste production, cannot be determined. lt is not st all nnlilrely, ss
some commentator hos supposed, thet the ode wss sent to Maecenas on his birthdsy,
sod wss only thrown into the form of sn eddress to Phyllis lor poeticsl convenience.
