596 HORATII FLACCI

EPISTLE [X.
amc. 734.

As ιο Septimius, cn whose behelf this Epistle is addressed ιο Tiberius, see C. ii. 6,
Introduction. 'l'he occasion was that journcy into Armenio which hasbeen referred
ιο twice before (lep. 3 and 7). lt is a well-considered and careful productiora. Horace
would have written more warmly for such an intimate friend if ιο could lmve ventur&
ιο do s0; but the character of Tiberius did not¹ admit of warmth, aad he would not
have responded ιο any very eas-nest eulogy. Horace therefore satislies himself with
merely narning his friend and excusing his own bolslness in doing sc.

This llpistle is noticed in au amusing article of the Spectator (No. 493) on the
subject of introductione aud testimouisls iu genem, of which this is quoted aa a
jodicious specimen, aad e loose translation is there given.
