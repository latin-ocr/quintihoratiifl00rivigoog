HORATII FLACCI

CARMEN VII.

1.. Munatius Plancus, who followed O. Julius Caesar both in Gaul and in his war with
Pompey, alter Caesar's death attached himself to the republican party, but very soon
afterwards joined Augustus ς then followed Antenyto the Elast, and nno. 722, the year
before Actium, joined Augustus again. lt is supposed that about this time, perhaps ut
the suggestion of Augustus, who was anxious to secure Plancus und ιο keep him from
leaving Italy, Horace wrote him this ode while his mind was perplexed sud bs vas
perhaps meditating retirement from Rome ιο Greeoe.

1 think all this is very doubtlirl, and with lusere (p. 808) 1 munet but think it uneer·
tuin whether this Plancus is intended at all. It may have been his son, who is probably
the Munatius referred to in Epp. i. 8. 31, or some other Plancus. But even if the fatiem·
be the man, 1 cannot see any such serious purpose in the ode ss the above theory im·
plica, nor do Ι believe Augustus attached any such velue ιο the renegade's mdstancc.
He appears ιο bave been a contemptible person. Thatthe temple of Jrnus vas not
closed at the time is tme (r. 20), but that does not fix the date before the battle of
Actium. 1 thinlr the name of Plancus ie again used more aa a convenience than sny
thing else, though there is perhaps s little more individuality given to this ode than te
the fourth. The story of Teucer bes all the appearance ofs Greek origin.

1.. Munatius Plancus, above referred to, was consalin amo. 712. See C. ili. 14. 27.
