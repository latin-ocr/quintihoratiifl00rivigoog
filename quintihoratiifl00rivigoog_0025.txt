Tua materiale for Horaee’s life are derived almost entlrely from his
own works. A few additional facts are got from a short memoir
attributed to Suetonius.

He was born on the 8th December, mtto. 689 (ac. 65), at or near
Venusia¹ (Venosa), in the Apenninee, on the borders of Lucania and
Apulia. His father was a freedman², having, ae his name provee, been
the slave of some person of the Horatia gens. As Horace implles that
bs himself was ingenuus⁸, his father must have obtained his freedom
before his birth. He afterwards followed the calling of a coacter⁴, a
collector cf money iu some way or other, it is not known in what. He
made in this capacity enough to purchase an estate, probably a small
one, near Venusia. We hear nothing of his mother, except that Horace
speaks of both his parents with affection ⁸. Hie father, probably sceing
signs of talent in him as a child, was not content to have him educated
at a provincial school, but took him (at what age he does not say, but
probably about twelve) to Rome, where he became a pupil of Orbilius
Pupillusl, who had a school of much note, attended by boys of good
family, and whom Horace remembered all hie life ee an irritable toacher,
given unneeeesarily to the use of the rod. With him he learnt grammar,
the earlier Latin authors, and Homer. He attended other masters (of
rhetoric, poetry, and music, perhaps) as Roman boys were wont, and
had the advantage (to which he afterwards looked back with gratitudo)
of hie father's care and moral training during this part of his education.
It was usual for young men of birth a'nd ability to be sent to Athens to

tinish their education by the study of Greek literature and philosophy ·

under native tcaehers3 and Horace went there too, at what age is not
known, bnt probably when he was about twenty. Whether hie father
was alive at that time or dead ie uncertain. If he went to Athens at
