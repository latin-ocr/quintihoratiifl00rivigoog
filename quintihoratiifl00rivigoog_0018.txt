xiv PREFACE.

allusione in modern writings become after a few years. Horace did
a good deal to improve the Latin language, and he took the liberty,
which he defends, of saying many things in a new way. His
poetical power was great and varied 3 and if he had possessed more
energy οἱ· character, he might have done even more than he has.
But what he has left is a proos of his talant. He gave the Romans,
as far as their language would permit, a set of lyrical compositions
both in matter and form not unworthy copies or imitations of the
Greek3 and though such imitation is a confession of inferiority and
sometimes is feeble and trifling‚ he still shows that he could infuse
the vigour of the Latin tongue into the mensures of Sappho and
Alcaeus, and present to us a variety of natural and plcasing
images in language simple, concise, and expressive. A last careful
reading of Horace’s lyrio poems, after a long acquaintance with
them, has made me estimatc them higher than Ι did, and even
when he is less successful, I feel more indulgence towards the poet
for daring so much and doing it so well.

Mr. Macleane has made some judicious remarks on Horace in his
Introduction ς and a recent writer in “ Blackwood’s Magazine”
(No. Dcxxx.), “On the Causes of Horacc's Popularity,'’ has
written an instructive and agreeable essay.

“ But how do we know that wehave what Horace wrote? Α work
which has come down to us fmm a very remote time by successive
transcriptione must oontain many errors. Even books when they
have been often reprinted differ very much from the original. 'l'he
general consent of the manuscripts ol Horace is the only evidence
of what he wrote 3 and it isa wonder that the diversities in the
text are not more than they are. But these diversities are sufficient
to prove that in many passages we cannot discover the true read·
ings, and we never shall. It is the business of the critic to use the

’ documentary evidence of the manuscripts, and to attempt to darive

from the various readings some probable conclusion. This branch
of the critical art requires great labour, judgment, and tacte, and we
are much indebted to scholare for what they have done towards
establishing the text of Horace and other ancient writers. I have
had neither time nor inclination to do any thing for Horace in this
