This work of correcting Horace and other writers still goes on,
¹and will go on as long as there are printers to print. It is doubtful
whether we are going backwards or forwards in the critical art, for
some of the newest emendations are the worst. We hare a proposal
by Lachmann and Haupt (Keller) to write ‘Thynus' for ‘Poenus'
in (111. 13, 14. I do not know what-objection these critice made
to ‘Poenus :’ Bentley has let it pass unmolested. ‘Thynos’ was
probably suggested by ‘Thyna merce' (0. iii. 7. 8), and ‘ Bithyna'
(C. i. 35. ⁷3 Epp. i. 6. 33). Here the argument turns entirely on
the propriety of the expression ‘navita Bosporum Poenus :³ the
evidence is for the common reading. Horace continually uses
proper names to give life and complexion to his poetry, and there
are instances in which he uses them, as far as we can see, where
other proper names would do as well if they had suited his verse.

If the ‘navita’ must have some life put into him bya name, Icould

not think of one better than Poenus, whether Horace used itin the
larger or more limited sense3 nor if the poet wished to put his
‘navita’ on the roed to some great and distant seat of commerce,

· could ho have chosen a more troublesome course for him than beat-

ing up the Bosporus against a strong current. What the ‘navita
Thynus' would be doing there I cannot tell, as the Thyni were not

¹ 'there is an example ο1 Bentley’s perverse argumentation on Epod. xv. 15, where,
atter proposiug and desending ‘offensi’ instead of ‘offensae' at the end 11 'his note he
says that ‘offensae' may stand, 11 a man will interpret it aa he does. His interpreta-
tion may certainly be accepted. Iu S. i. 9. 1, he inserts ‘ut' aster ‘ibam,’ because ha
does not like tha expression ‘ibam' alone, and he defends hia ‘ut’ by quoting among
other passages one 111111 Terence, Phormio, iv. ala: ‘Ut abii abs te, iit forte obviam mihi
Phormio? which is quite a different thing. In the same satire, v. 86, ho puts ‘ vadatus’
a conjecture, in the place 11 ‘ vadato,' because, as he says, in this formula ‘respondere’
ls used absolutely, and he gives examples, 11 which thera are plenty, but not one where
the word ‘vadari’ occurs. ‘Respondete vadato' would be as regular as ‘respondere
accusatori ς’ and Bentley can only bring the text 1ο his supposed standard of uni·
formity by changing ‘vadato' into ‘vadetua’ and giving to ‘vadatus' a passive sigui-
fication, which it apparare that it had in some writers before Horace, aud some long
aster his time. It has been suggested that ‘vadato' isan ablativa in a passive sensa
(Kriiger), a suggestion in which thare may be something ; and it leaves tho genuim
rbadiug namucum.
