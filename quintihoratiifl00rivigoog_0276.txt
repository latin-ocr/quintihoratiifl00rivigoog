240 ‚HORA'PII FLACCI

Si chartae sileant quod bene feceris

Mercedem tuleris. Quid foret Iliae
Mavortisque puer si taciturnitas

Obsteret meritis invida Romuli?

Ereptum Stygiis fluctibus Aeacum οε
Virtus et favor et lingua potentium

Vatum divitibus consecrat insulis.

Dignum laude virum Musa vetat mori:

Caelo Musa beet. Sic lovis interest
Optatis epulis impiger Hercules,

Quassus eripiunt aequoribus rates,
Ornatus viridi tempora pampino
Liber vota bonos ducit ad exitus.

Itis singular that the ode which of cll others dwelis most on the moral virtues oi the
person addressed should be written to one whose morel character has been so much
blechened es thet of M. Lollius. The integrity which Horace so highly commende is
that particular virtue in which, according to the testimony of the historiae Velleius
