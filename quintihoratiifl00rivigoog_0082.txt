CARMEN XVIII.

There is preserved in Athenaeus, x. p. 430, a single line of Alcaeus, of which the flrst
verse of this ode is almosta literal translation. The matre also is the same. The verse
is aa follows (44 Bergkl: μηθὲν ἄλλο φυτεύσῃς πρότερον δένδρεον ἀμπέλω. Τιι rest of
the ode is, in all probability, aclose adaptation of the poem of Alcaeus. If we were not
put upon the right scant, as Ι think we are, by the ebore fragment, wo should suppose
Horace bada friend Varus, who bed a villa at Tibur, and who was making a plantation
there. Varus was the cognomen of his aud Virgil’s friend Quintilius, whose death is
lamented in C. xxiv. of this book. But whether or no he is the person hera referred
ιο, cr (which appears to Buttmann, and 1 agree with him, the better way of putting it)
whose name is used for ιιι purpose of giving spirit to the ode, it is quite impostore to
say. “ Sterilem agrum frmtra rimeris,” as ιιιιιιι judiciously says on another equally
impossible question. It bas been doubted whether Horace wrote ‘Vere' or ‘vera' iu
consequence cf a note which appears in the two Scholiasta, Acron and Comm. Cruq„
“ suadet ιιι cum verunm competens tempus est nullam arborem prius quarn ritem ponat,”
from which it has been inferred that they had ‘vere' in their copies. Some confirma·
tion of this theory is derived from Virg. Georg. ii. 319 sq. :—

“ Optima vinetis satio cum vere rubenti
Candida venit avis longis invisa colubris.”

illexisting MSS. and editions have ‘Vara' Jahn affirms that the person is ‘haud
dubic,' the same as Canidia's old lover, Epod. v, and Weichert (de h. Varii et Cassii
Parmensis vita) says the sama Such boldness appears ιο me most irrational. 'l'hc
respectable names of these scholare have misled the writer of tho article Varus (xii.) in
Smith's Dict. Biog, who might have corrected his judgmeut by referring ιο Ειιιό, to
whose work ιι refers others.

Torrentius believes the person ιο ιι tbat unfortunate Varus whose legions were cat
off by Arminius in Germany, an. 10. But aa he supposes Catullus to have addressed
ιιι same person (0. ι), who was bisjunior hyat least halfe century, his judgment is
worth nothing. Other conjectures have been hazarded by scholare of repnte, which
listre bas stated and disposed of very clearly.

“Of Quintiliua' Villa ruins yet remain at Tiroli in the quarter called after him Quin·
tigliolo,'' says ree, a credulons but industrious commentator.
