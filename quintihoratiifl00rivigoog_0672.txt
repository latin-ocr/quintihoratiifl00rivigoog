636 HORATII FLACCI

EPISTLE XVIII.

Here we have some more advice about the manner οι winning ιιο favour οι the
great. The person addreseed ie Lollius (introductiouto Epp. 2οι thie bools). ‘llrough
a distinction ie drawn between vulgar flattery end retiued, aud the first ie condemned,
which in this case could scarcely be necessary, it would be hard ιο imagine any thing
ruore degrsding to a dne and independent mind than the arte by which this young
man ie taught to rise. lt seems aa if Horece thought there was danger os his being
ioolish enough to prefer his books or his recreatione or intellectuel privacy ιο the
boieterous tastee or varying humoure os a patrem—a rolly οι which he must by
uo means be guilty. He was of an ingenuous disposition ilthcre is any meaning
iu the first verse; but he was ιο school hie tongue und hie manaem ιο a relined
servility, and ιο consider this aet a virtue. 'l'hat Horace was himself tired of the lil'e
he recommends, we may infer srom the elosing verses. lt would have been more
mauly if ιο had held up his experieuce in the way of warning ιο the young uren that
ιο should avoid these dungerous and dirty wetere. Horace’e was not a vigemus
mind, but amiable, and in the small ways of the world sagacious ιο pereoive bnt not
prompt ιο aet.

The date ie generally assumed to he ene. 734, the year in which the sundsrde
were restored by the Parthians. This depende partly on the accurecy oi the reading in
v. 56, where sce note.

ARGUMENT.

Unlees 1 em mistaken iu you, my irank Lollius, yon are not the person ιο act the
parasite under the garb os a friend. 'l'here ie as much differeuee between the two as
between a chaate metron and a herlot. But even u greater fault than thie ie an
affectation οι roughness which cells iteelf liberty and virtue. Real virtue is a mesu
between opposite vices. Yon shall see one at the rich man’s table trembling at his
every look, eatching up and echoing hie words like a school-bey or second-part
actor 3 while another brawls sor tritlcs aeone who would not give up a point or have
his bawliug etopped, no, not if you'd give him his lire over again

(v. el.) (irent people have a horror of the rnau ol pleneus-e, ιιο gambler, tha corcomh,
the corstona, though they may be ten times worse themselves ; or the petron, if hc
sees one aping him, will, ir he be kind, admoniah him, saying, “I can afl'ord to bea
little loolish: you cannot.” Eutrapelus, if he hed a spite against any one, would
give him some due clothes; for ιο knew they would change the nran'e character
entirely, that he would turn idle, profligate, spendthritt, and corne to abject poverty
in the end.

(v. 37.) Yon must never be inquisitiva about your patron's secrete, or betray
them; nor praiae your testes at the expense of his; nor take to your books
when. he wenta to go ont hunting. On such grounds the brothers Amphion
and Zethus quarrelledJand aethe one yielded to the other, so do you yield ιο
your petron’e kind commanda: put away your books and go with him ιο ιιι
οιιοο, and like him earn your dinncr by your toil, ae theold Romans did, especially
now you are young und ewilt and strong, admired in the Campus, aud experienced
in war under our great commender. Besides you have no excuse, l’or yon know
what rnauly sparte are, you who have practieed eham hghte at your futhcr's place in
the country. lle who thinks your tusto aecords with his, will praise your amrme-
mcute ιο ιιι ekies.
