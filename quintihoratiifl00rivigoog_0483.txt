SA'PIRARUM II. 2. 447

coutentment, is a pleasant picture, and helpe by contrast toillustrate the gluttoncuaaud
‚ luxurians habits cf the city, which, though they had not yet reached the height they came
ιο under the training of Apicius (“qui in ea urbe, ex qua aliquando philosophi velut cor·
ruptores juventutis abire jussi sunt, scientiam popinae professus disciplina eus seculum
infecit.’' Seu. Cone. ad Helv. 10), were already very bad. As political activity grew
danger-om and diminished, and wealth poured into tha city, sensual indulgence grew
rapidly. Dining began at what we should consideran early hcur ς and the rich passed
most of their eveniugs over the table, which was furniahed with delicacies and ornaments
at anos-mous expense. 'l'he art cf cooking must bava been brought ιο great perfectiora
iu tha course of that period during which eating and drinking was the chief feature in
a Roman’s day 3 bnt Horace probably only saw it in ita iufaucy. Juvenal and Martisl
are more fullon this matter. Flesh, dab, aud fowl, and made dishes of every kind,
were imparted from all quarters. The art of digeation was as much studied as the art
of the kitchen, but diseaaes of course multiplied. Convivial amusementa were neces-

sarily invented to beguile these long meals3 the science of conversation flourished, and “

emuli talk was a trade, professional diuers-out (⁸ parasiti ’) being required to keep tha
company alive wbenever their own resources failed. This deflection lrom the simplicity
of the early days cf Rome is a melancholy feature in the history ol the Empire5 but
it required perhaps a stronger and sterncr pen then Horace's ιο treet it thoroughly.
This satire, the fourth, and the eighth, throw some light cn culinary details ς but tho
viee of gluttony‚ which must have gone considerable lengths even at this tima, might
have been more vigorously attached. It forms nc part of the corruptions pointed out
for reformation in the odes. Horace himself, though abstemious in his own appetite,
dined'e good deal with the rich, and may not have thought it expedient or graciosa to
sttack them eu such a point.

ARGUMENT.

The value of amoderate fare come learn from me (on the authority of the plain sanaible
Ofella), not with the glitter of plate in your eyes, but now, before you have broken
your fast. He who would judga truly usust have an unbiassed'y'udgment.

(v. 9.) Go, get up your appetite with hunting or bell-play cr the queit, and then see
whether you will despice humble fare and reject the drink that is not minglad with
Hymettian hcney. If the butler ia abroad and no fish is ιο be had, ycnr belly will
be content with dry breed and salt. How ia this? Why the pleasuro of eating does
not lie iu the savour of the meat, but in yourself. Iret labour supply you with sance.
The most tempting dainties give no pleasuro ιο the bloated stomach. Yet scaree any
argument will prevent your preferring a peacock to a barn-door lovel, merely because
it hasa line teil, and coste more money. How can you tell where that tlah was
caught? Yon delight in s mullet of three pounda weight, and yet you must cut it
into fragments ιο serve it ιο your friends. But why then don’t you like the big
lupus? Why, because the one is hig by nature, the other mall, aud you like what ia ·
unuatural and raro. The hungry belly, cn the other hand, seldom despises a thing
manescit is common. “I like ιο see a huge beast stretched cut on ahuge dish,”
says the glutton. Blow south winda and rot their dainties! But let them alone, they
are as good ss rotteu already for appetitas that want rather stimulante than food.
But theac luxuries are only ct late growth‚ and some day we shall have roaat gulls in
fashicn.

(v. 58.) But moderatiora is not meanness, and it is ol' no use to avoid one fault only to
fall inte another. Avidienus puts old fruit aad soar wine before his friends, and ia
stingy of his stiuking cil, even cn holidays. Which would you rather imitata?
Respectability lies in a middle coatrae, avoiding excessive strictness, but equally
avoiding a slorenly carelessness.
