Tuus end the flue following odes are generally admitted to be among the lineet speci-
mens of Horaoe's manner, end it appears to me that in this diductio style he shows
most of his own character and genius It is, as fur us wo hnow, entirely his own.
There is no opinion from which Ι moro entirely dissent than this of Freulse¹ “Tota
Horatii poesis lyrica ct er ipsias sententia dici et hubori potest amatoria '' (F. H. p. sl).
And Buttmann's sentence, which goes into the other extreme, appears tc me as fer
from ιιι ιιιιιι, unless ιι limita it, as 1 believe he really meant to do, to the style that
hacke thinks his stmngest. ‘⁴ N on·reality,'' he says, “ is an essentia] feature of Horace’s
odos? Τιι fact appears to be, that reality was so much a part of Horace's mind, that
he was never so great as when ιι wrote on some real subject, something thet drew out
luis sonnd common sense, his regard for ιι friend, his sense of right, his appreciation of
nature, end his feelings in respect to ιιι times he lived in, and especially the condition
of Rome itself. It· is thie that gives to the six odes with which ιιι third book opens
ιιι feroc and charnu we lind in them. It has boen already said (C. ii. 15, Introduc·
ιιοιι) that they appear all ιο have been written about the suune time with one another
and with other cules, when Augustus set himself the taslr of social reformation after
the closo of the civil wars.

Τιι general pnrport of this ode is an exhortation to moderate living and desires.

The first starum is generally understood to haue been added as an introduction to the
six odes, viewed as a whole.

ARGUMENT.

Τιι worldly 1 despice, but hare new precepta for ιιι young.

Kings rulo osor their people, bnt are themselves the subJ'ects of Jove. Ouo may be
richer, another nohlor than his' follows, but all alilse must die. No indulgence can
get sleop for him who has a swerd ever hanging ouer him, while it disdains nottho
dwellings of the poor. He who is content with a little fears not storm or drought.
'l'he rich man builds him honses on ιιι very wetere, but anxiety follows him go
where ιι will. If then marble sud purple, rich avices aud eostly perfumea cure not
grief, why should I build me great houscs, or exclrange for the burthen of riches my
humble Sabine farm?
