matter. Ido not feel that I have any peculiar aptitude for this
kind of work, and the same may be said of many who have under-
takeu it. I have, however, noticed nearly all the variatione in
Ritter's text, and I think that some of thern are improvements. Ι
have notieed also some of Keller's readings in the Odes, but Ι have
found very little in them that seems to me of any valae.

When the manuscripts agree, and there is nothing unintelli-
gible, it is consistent with the evidence to let a passage stand as it
is, and it is inconsistent to attempt to improve it. When there is
diversity of readings in any case, we must determine which we will
accept on a balance of probabilities. If no reading gives a sufficient
sense, we may endeavour to extract from the supposed false readings
something which does give a sense and may be what the copiers
would have written if they had taken due care. Many excellent
corrections have been made in this way, and they commend them-
selves to our judgtaent as true, that is, as possessing sufficient
probability to be accepted astrue.

There is another method which we may use in decidiug between
conflicting readings, and also in determiuing whether a passage,
where there ie no variation in the readings, may be considered
genrune. In the ease of Horace, for example, ifwe study the
general purpose of each poem, if we have made ourselves well ac-
quainted with hia manner of expression and his poetic colouring,
and if we fix our attention closely on all the words of a given pas-
sage, and the connexion of the whole passage with that which
precedes and follows, we may often determine with great probability
what he intended to write, where the evidence leaves it doubtful;
and we may also determine whether critics are justified in pntting
their own guesses in place of the documentary evidence, when there
is no variation in it. 'Phe power of justly interpreting is therefore
a necessary qualification fora critic who undertakes to settle a text
whether ancient or modern; as necessary aa it isser the commen·
tator who undertakes to explain his author. 'lhere are indeed in
Horace many passages, where the text may be quite right, and yet
the interpretation is doubtful. Ihavc found more of these passages
thanI expected, and some about which editors will always differ.
