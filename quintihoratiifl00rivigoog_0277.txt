CARMINUM IV. 9. 241

the medium oi statements made at a time when every one was ready ιο abuse the most
virtuons who were out of court faveam. Lollius, as we have seen (C. iv. 2, lut), was
defeated mmo. 738 by the Sigambri, but he retained his great influence with Augustus,
whom it was not easy, we may believe, to impose upon. At any rate, ii he was hypo·
erite enough ιο deceive Augustos, Horace may be encused sor aasigning ιο him excel·
lenciea he did not possess. 'l'ha date of the ode ia not at all certain. The defeat oi
Lollius, which caused a great deal oi alarm at Bonae, very probably raised many voices
against him, and gave an advantage ιο hia enemies3 audit ia not improbable that
Horace wrote thia ode ιο meet their attacks, and to console him under hia defeat. The
confident tone that runs through it bringa the ode under the remark made in the
introduction ιο Ode 6 oi this boola.
ARGUMEN T.

Think not that my verses will die= though Homer stands first among poeta, Pindar,
Simonides, Alcaeus, Stesichorus, Anacreon, Sappho—these all survive. Helen was
not the first woman that loaed; nor Ilium the only city that has been sacked ς nor
the heroes oi the iliad all that have fought; but the rest have been iorgotten, be·
cause they baveno poet to sing of them. Baried virtue is little better than hnried
dnlneas. Iwill not therefore let thy labours pass unaung, Lollius, thy sagacity and
uprightness, thy mind frea stom avaric'e and secure hom corruption. It is not the
poeseasm oi riehes thet ia wealthy, but the man who knows how to use the giits oi
Heaven and to andare poverty, who lantes corruption, aud is ready ιο lay down his
lii'e ior his country or his friends.
