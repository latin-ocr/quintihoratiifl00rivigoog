CARMINUM III. 12.

Non times detur ; socerum et scelestas
Folle sorores,

Quae velut nautae vitulos leaenae

Singulos eheu lacerant: ego illis

Mollior nee te feriam neque intra
Claustra tenebo.

Me pater saevis oneret eatenis

’ Quod viro olemens misero peperci3

Me vel extremos Numidarum in agros
Classe releget.

Ipedes quo te rapiunt et aurae

Dum favet nox et Venus, i seeundo

Omine et nostri memorem sepulcro

Sealpe querelam.

hortandum,'' the meaning of which is not very clam. 'lhe way 1 understand the first
staua and ita connexion with the seoond may ha aean from the Argumeut. Some aup-
pose that Neobnle is eontrastiug her own condition with that oi others. ‘Miser-able are
the women who cannot indulge iu lore end wine ς lor thee, Neobule, it isotherwisa' 1
do not quarrel with that interpretation, but prefer the other. There ia a fragmen oi
Alosum (58 Bergk) that may hare belonged to a poem which furnished tha materiale
of this ode. Some hare assumed it to bea free translation from Aleaeua' poem Thera
