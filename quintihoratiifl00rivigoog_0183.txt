OARMHN IV.
About aue. 728.

Pursuing his purpose, Horace here commende the power of wiedom and learning in
subdoing brute force aad violent passione. If amo. 728 be the year in which Horace
met with his accident (C. ii. 13), this ode could not have been written before that year,
for the circumstance ie referred to in v. 27. The expedition intended for Britain, but

Ι turned against Spain, took place that year, and seems to Franhe to be alludcd to in the

aiath atanaa. Δ Parthian expedition was in contemplation at the same time. The
alludens ιο violent men unrestrained by the Muses appear to the same writer ιο have
τοιοτοῐιοο ιο Cornelius Gallus and M. Egnatius Rufus, both disatiectcd men, the fomrer
of whom destroyed himself, aad the latter conspired against Augustus' life, both in the
above year (Dion. (lass. liii. 23, 24). This may οι· may not be trae, but it is consistent
with the uotiua, which some chronologice are not, that all these six odes were written
about the nme time. 'Ibat Horace was still a frequenter οι Baiae appears from v. 24.
But when he wrote Epp. i. 15, which was probably composed nuo. 731, he bad been
forbidden by the doctor to go there, which Franks also notice· aa limiting the date of
the ode.
