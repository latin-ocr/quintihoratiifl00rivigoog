INTRODUGTION. xxix

ipsius habui ostendi ” (on S. i. 6. 41). The same Scholiaet refers more

than once to books that had been written on the persons mentioned by
Horace. A reference to Estrd’s work spoken ofin the Profaoe will

show theta catalogue of these persons embraces nearly all the distin·
guished men of the day, with most of whom Horace was on friendly
terme.

The Matres adopted by Horace from the Greek are thirteen in

number in the Odes, and six in the Epodes. I purpose saying only a
few words on each.

G. i. l.—Tbe metro of this Ode is one of three, called after

Asclepiades, a lyric poet of uncertain date. It consiste of single lines
dirided thus:

--l-ool-ll-ool-o:

The oseem usually falle on the long syllable after the end of the
second foot. There are two exceptione only in Horace, ii. 12. 25, and
iv. 8. 17. The Greeks did not follow this rule, and their lines were
less monotonous in consequence. The division of this metro by
choriambi is against the obvious rhythm. Ο. iii. 30, iv. 8, belong to
the mmo.

C. i. 2.-This metro takes ite name from Sappho. It consiste of
stamas of four verses each. The first three ere alike, and consist of
four trocheon, with a dactyl in the third place. Horace always sub· ,
etitntes a spondeo for the second trocheo, with one uncertain exception,
C. S. 70. The fourth verso consiste of a dactyl aud spondeo, and is
named an Adonie.

This is one of the commoneat metros. It differs in Horace's hands
from the Greek usage by the less frequent introduction of the trochee
in the second place, and from the caesura usually falling after the
fifth syllable. This arrangement takes away a good deal from tho
vigonr of the metro, a defect which Horace seems to have pereeived
when he wrote the Carmen saeculare and the Sapphic Odes of the
fourth book ¹.

7 1 subjoin some remarks hom the “Journal of Education,” leae (vol. iv. p. 356),
on Dr. Oareys “Latin Prosody made say? The author observem “ It greatly oon·
duces to the harmony of the Sapphic verse to make the mesura at the ouh semifoot, aa
'Diva quem proles Niobea magnae ;’ not as ‘Haec Jovom sentire Deosque cunctos,³ '’
-a very common opinion. To which the reviewer replies= ‘⁴ Toour ears the latter is at
least as melodicus as tho former, consisting of a dactylinterposed between twoaoeentual
ditroehees, as in tha lines quoted by Dr. Carey from Catullus and Sappho:

wammam ἀθάνατ’ Ἀφροδίτα]
‘Pauca nuntiate meae puellae ς’
