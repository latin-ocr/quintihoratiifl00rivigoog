EPISTLE VI.

, Wbo Numicius srus nobody can tell, and it does not signily. Any other nurus would
hare done as well, Nothing turns upon the character or circumstances ol ιιο person
nominally addressed, and l feel inclined ιο put the ldpistle in ιιο same light os several
ol the Odes, in which, as l have often hod ocession ιο remark, ο name seems to ιο
introduced more ιο give lile ιο ιιο poem than lor sny other resson. 'l'he Numisia was
ο patrician gens ol no great note.

ln respect ιο ιιο time of composition, the only guide iar. ιιι “Cum bene notum
Porticus Agrippae et vlu te conspexerit Appi,’' and that does not asslst us much. (See
note.)

As to the design of the Epistle, it is ιο support virtue, under the aspect or* s calm
sels-content as the chief good. The ordinary standards ol happiness ars merted with
contempt, and there is a strong vein ci irony running through the greater part ol* the
Epistle, as will ιο seeu by ιιο Argument.

ARGUMEN'I'.
'l'he only way ιο get happiness aud to keep it, Numicius, is ιο save the mind from ex·

citement. There οι·ο wise men who can look calmly on ιιο uwl'ul skies. what. do '

you suppose thoy think of ιιο trcusuros ol the earth aud sea, and the towards ol a

' paltry ambitioni But ιο who feers their oppositos is excited just as much as he who
desires these things themselves: each is taken by surprise, and in either csse there
is uncasiness. Bc it joy or grief, desire or leur, what is ιιο differenoe if every thing
that falls ont a little otherwise then is expected strikss a man dumb sud makes him
stare like an idioti Nsy, ιο who sceks virtue herself in excessis mad though ιο ιο
wisc, und a knare though ιο ιο good.

(v. 17.) Now then, go run aster line things r delight yourself in tho praisss ol a moh ς
riae earlyand sleep late, that ιιο lellow Mutus may not be richer and therefom mors

that is brilliant in the earth: ultor all your admiration you shall go whithcr gruter
men have gone before you.
(r. 28.) lt' youare sick, yon take physic. Yon want to be happy ol course Theuil
virtue be the only means, be resolute, make every sacrifice, sud follow her. ,
(r. el.) ll virtue be but ο name, make haste to be rich ι off with you before any one

Lore are in ber trein blind you are not like the poor king ol' Cappadocis. llo,
look at Lucullus, who knew not how much he had got= that ls your only sich man:
ke had plenty lor himself and the thieres too. Sc il* money is to make you happy,
make thot your drst ohy'ect and your last.

(v. 4⁰.) But il you are for honours and show, why then get yoursell s man ιο
