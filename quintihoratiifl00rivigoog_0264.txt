228 ῌΟΒΑΤΙΙ FLACCI

Lateque victrices catervae
Consiliis juvenis revictae
sensere quid mens rite, quid indoles ae
Nutrita faustis sub penetralibus
Posset, quid Augusti paternus
In pueros animus Nerones.
Fortes creantur fortibus et bonis ς
Est in juvencis, est in equis patrum eo
Virtus, neque imbellem feroces
Progenerant aquilae columbam3
Doctrina sed vim promovet insitam,
Rectique cultus pectora roborant5
Utcunque defecere mores
Indecorant bene nata culpae.
r Quid debeas, 0 Roma, Neronibus
'Pestis Metaurum flumen et Hasdrubal
Devictus et pulcher fugatis
Ille dies Latio tenebris ’
Qui primus elma risit adorea,
Dirus per urbes Afer ut Italas
Ceu flamma per taedam vel Eurus
Per Siculas equitavit undae.
