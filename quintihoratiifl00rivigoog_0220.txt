HORATII FLACCI

OARMEN XVII .

'l'he short ode, Ο. i. 26, and this ode were addressed ιο tha nme person, L. Aelius
Lamia (see Introduction ιο C. i. 26). The languago of the former ode has led to the
infarenoe that Lamia was a young man of desponding disposition, aud this that he was
prond and vain-glorious-asort of criticism impertinentand unreasonable as it seems to
ma. What is clear is no more thau that Lamia was s young man of good birth, being of
the Aelia gens, who were plebeians, but of old standing. Lilreother faurllies tha Iamiaa
were perhaps glad to traco their origin to ι fabulous hero, aud believed their founder to
be Lamus, lring of the Laestrygoninns, the builder of Formiae, froin whence they must
have migrated ιο Roma (see last ode, v. 33 ο)ι Horace had evidently un affection for
tha young man lamia, whose father wasa friend of Cicero, and died rich. It is not
improbable the ode was written at his house in the country, whether at Formiae (“quod
valde probabilc,'’ says J ani, 1 don't sea why) or elsewhere. lt has no particular merit,
and could have eost Horace little labonr. He mnat have written many such that hsva
never been published‚ and these two odes were probably included in the collection out
of compliment ιο Lamia. But there is not the least reason why Horace should be sup·
posed not ιο have baeu the author ofthe odc; and though it might do very well, perhaps
better, without the versas 2-5, which some editors would atrike out (Jani says, ‘⁴ haud
dubie spurii sunt,” aud hus a long excursus to prove it), but no MSS. omit it is tha
very worst species of criticism that endeavours to bring, by corrections, omissions, and
additions, the received text into conformity with soma standard which is presumed ιο
represent tha mind aad style of the author. If this system were not so common, espa·
cially among the commentator-s of Horace, old and new, it would seam superfluous ιο
say a word about it. Lamia had a brother Quintus, who died early, ιο the great grief of
Lucius (Epp. i. 14. 6). There was one of this family, according ιο the Scholiasts Acron
and Porphyrion2 who wrote comedies ; but there is uo reason to suppose it was Horaoe's
friend. In two passages Juvenal allodes ιο the Lamiae aa a family of distinction (S.
iv. 15³ r
) “ Sed pariit postquam cerdonibus esse timendus

Coeperat ς hoc nocuit lamiarum caede madeuti.”
and (vi. 885) r— ·

‘¹ Quaedam de numero Lamiarum ac nominis Appi
lit farre et vino lanum Vestamque rogabat ;’'

where they are associated with tha family of the Appii, though tha reading of the Mas,
varies, and ‘alti’ is now received. Tacitus (Anu. vi. 27), mentioniug the death of thia
Lamia, says his ‘genus’ was ‘decorum’
