of them bave any weight or authority. Torrentius mentions three MSS. which are
hesded “Ad Virgilium Unguentarium urbis discriptio (the common blunder for ‘de-
scriptio’) Pancratice? and he himself adopts this absurdity, derived from v. 17. Τιο
Scholiaat Acron says, “Ad Virgilium negociatorem scribit,’' which isa mere assumption
from the opening lines and v. 25, and when he interprete “juvenum nobilium” (v. 15)
as Augustus, or Musaeum, or the step-sous of Augustus, ιο shows ιο knew nothing of
what ιο was writing about. If the question were to ιο decided by numbers, it would
on the whole be given in favour of Virgil the poet, and the presumption is so much in
favour of that notion that the proof of the contrary lies 1 think with those who deny
it. Gesner says there is nothing iu the ode to indicate so warm a friendship as sub·
sisted between Horace and the poet Vergil. But the oda is at besta trifle, and an in·
vitatiou to dinner is not the moet inspiring subject. When Virgil wari going to aaa
perhaps for his health, Horacs’s feeling for him was shown strongly enough, which
would hu natural. Orelli and others object ιο ιιο expression '‘juvennm nobilium
eliens,’' as applied to Virgilius Maro. But if the Scholiasta ara agreed that 'juvenum'
may mean Augustus and Maecenas, they st least concede the point that ‘cliens’
may mean Virgil the poet. Augustus is represented as n ‘juvenis' in tha second
ode of ιιο first bools, v. 41 ι. The difficulty that arises out of v. 26, ‘pone—studium
lucri,' Orelli himselfdisposes of, in his note on that verse, when ιο says that itis
evidently ajolo, for, though he also says iu the Introduction that sueh a joke, if it be
a joke, levelled at such a man would be very liat, this can hardly be determined till vva
know the point of it. We need not mame with Stephane (Diatr. iv. p. 76) that
Horace means by ‘studium lucri,' ‘mercaturam bonarum artium’ (Cic. ds Off. iii. 2), or
theexpeotation of payment for his verses. If there be a josevirgil understood it,
whoever Virgil ποις but be he who he may we do not understand it, so that nothing is
gained by this argument· Ihavenot seen all that has been said upon the subject,
which has been discussed in separate neue· and in all commentarius, and which must
always remam matter of opinion founded upon very slender datar bnt my own jsdg·

the praetor and friend of oceo? nor to a “physiciun of the Nerones,'' uor to a
