436 HOBATII FLACCI SATIRARUM I. 10.

notices Oraquiue bas inferred that Horace alludes to (l. Cornelius Gallus, the intimate
friend of all lloracc's friends, and of Vrrgil in particular (Bel. x.). No opinion cea be
more improbable than tbis. Out of the word ‘Vivaliuur' (evidently corrupt) in Acroa'e
note, Bentley has conjectured, with some appearance of probability, that M. ιιιιὶιιι
Bibaculus is the person referred to. This poet, who was born at Cremona amc. 652
(see Olinton F. Η. sub aa), is mentioned aith respect by Quintilian (x. 1. 96), and
elassed with Catullus and Horace as a satirist. But Quintilian alsoquotee (viii.6.17)
with disapprohation the verse of this same person imitated by Horace in S. ii. 5. 41,
“Juppiter hibernae eane nive conspuit Alpes? The affectation noticed in this verae,
and continued perhaps in others that followed, may account for Barias's cognomen,
given him probably by bis contemporaries generally and therefore sufficient for them
ιο recognize him by. Some think be is ιο called from his birthplace, from which Acron
calls him ‘Gallum poetam :' others because ιι wrote s poem (πραγματεία ιιι Scholiasta
eall it) on Cacsar's Gallie war, from which the above verse istalren. Bentley prefers
the flrst of these three reasom, aad 1 agree with him. 'lhe epithet ‘turgidas' applica
ιο his persora aad is explained by ιιι description giren of him in the ebore place,
“ pingui tentus omaso.'' He is said to bave murdered Memnon, auditis generally said
that this refers to a translation he is supposed to have made of the Aethiopicos Arcti-
nus, one of the cyclic poete, in which Memnon was one of the principal heroes. Dacier
suggests that ιι wrote a tragedy with this title, to which notion the following lines
gire soma probability. Horace says that ilarius, like some rude artists, had made a

figure of Rhenus witha head of clay, referring tc ιιι statues by which the ducant .

river gods were represented, and to some description this poet bad giren of the ιοιιιιιι
of the Rhine, probably in the abore poem on the Gallie war. There is a very different
representation of Rhenus ona madal of Dareus, in Oiselins' Thesaurus, ΡΙ. 24, 6, where
be appears ae a majestic ligure, recliaing with bis left arm resting on his aru, and in
his right band a reed partly broken, which latter symbol appears ιο ιιιι been fami·
liar ιο Ovid, for he writes, describing ιιι triumph of Tiberius, aar. 12 (ox Pont iii.

‘Delingo' is to fsehion out, aud differs little from ‘fingo ι’ ‘didlngo' (C. i. 35. 39 n.) is
tc break up and fashion anesv. Nererthelese some MSS. and editions have ‘diffingit'
here. Dillenbr. says this word “baud dubie reprehensionem continet at simile verbum
deformare.” I do not agree with him. If ‘deformare' were substitutcd it would
either hare the same meaning that I hare given to ‘delingit’ or it would signify dis·
ligures, which sense tbe passage will not bear. 'l'herc is a chapter in Gellius (xviii. 11)
in which be defends Furius from the adverse judgment of Caesellius Vindex, who pro·
nounced him affected, and said be had spoilt the Latin tongae hythe invention of new
words, of some of which he gives specimeus. The hesding of the chapter malros this
ιἰιιὶιιι ιο ιι Aulus lbi-ius of Antium ; but ιι ιι was a poet held in high esteam, and
one whom Virgil largely imitated (Macrob. Satura. ri. 1), it ιιι been assumed that
‘¹ furii Antiatis,'’ ia the lemme to Gellius' chapter, is a corrupt reading (Weichert,
Post. Lat. p. 850 ιιι). Whatever the merite of Parim of Antimn may bave been, it
ispossible he may bare used the expressions Gellius quotm, aad they would not be more
or worse blemishee thau oue might find in most poem of the same length (his Annsls
mtended to apwards of claren boohs); and I see no good reason for suppoeing Furius
Bibaculus ιο ιι meant. It is carious however tbat one of the affectatione ascribed ιο
ιιι poet Gellius refers to, is “quod terram in lutum vasam ‘latescere’ dixerit.” lf
Bibaculus were ιιι author of this expression we might imagine that it had stnclr to bis
name, and that Horace uses ιιι expression 'luteum capnt' es referring to this pro·
rarbial represeb.
