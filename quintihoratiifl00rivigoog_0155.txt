About 110. 7116.

When Augustus had brought 110 civil ware 10 01 011, utI-0. 721, 10 applied himself
10110 reformation of manners, and Horace probably wrote 1110 011 other odes (ii. le.
111. 1-6) to promote 110 resume 01 1131011ος perhaps by his desire οι· thet of Maece·
110. ’11ογ were ull probably written between 1110. 725 and 728, and they should be
read together, and with C. i. 2. From the reference 10 110 temples 11 110 last staura,
it may be msumed perhaps that this 010011 iii. 6 were written about the same time,
that is 11726, when Augustus set himself particularly 10 restore the public buildings.
The authorities on the subject are Suetonius (0011130), Dion (ta. 1, 2), aud Velleius
(2. 89), 011110 Monumentum Ancyranum.

Augustus passed several sumptuary laus 10 keep (1011110 expensive habits 01 110

deelared ι “Tot a majoribus repertae leges, totqnss divus Augustus tulit, illae oblivione,
hae, quod flagitiosius 001, contemptu abolitae securiorem larum fecere ’³ (Tae Aen. iii.

ARGUMENT.

'l'hs rich man's 1111000 and doust-gardana und ponda are occupying all our once fertile
laud. 'lhis was nottho way 01 our ancestors, who had but little, while 11ιο state was
rich, who dwelt 11 10 spaoious houses 5 whom 110 101 bade content themselves with
a turs-rooled oottago, 011 beautify the¹ towns and templus with marble.
