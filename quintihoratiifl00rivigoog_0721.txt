EPIS'POLARUM II. e. 685

Nescio quod cupiens hortari coepit eundem ’ 35
Verbis quire timido quoque possent addere mentem:
“ 1, bone, quo virtus tua te vocat, i pede fausto,
Grandia laturus meritorum praemia. Quid stas ?’'
Post haec ille catus quantumvis rusticus: “ Ibit,

' Ihit eo quo vis qui nonem perdidit‚” inquit.
Romae nutriri mihicontigit, atque doceri
Iratus Graiis quantum nocuisset Achilles.¹
Adjecere bonae paulo plus artis Athenae,
Scilicet ut vellem curvo dignoscere rectum,
Atque inter silves Academi quaerere verum.
Dura sed emovere loco me tempora grato,
Civilisque rudem belli tulit cestus in arma
Caesaris Augusti non responsura lacertis.
