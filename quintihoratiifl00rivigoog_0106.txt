Cum mente, nec turpem senectam
Degere nec cithare carentem. 1ο

CARMEN XXXII.

This ode hae caused the commentatore much trouble. Whether it was meent to be
an introduction 1ο some poem Horace wrote or intended to write on oue 01 the eventa
01 the day, or what sort 01 song he was celred ferend by whom, are all questione that

havebeenfreely discuseed. The question turns in the first instance on the word with ⁸

which the ode begine. 'l'he Scholiasta read ‘Poscimur,' on which Acron's comment is
‘poscebatur dieta suc edere? Porphyriou’s ‘Erigitur a nobis nt cenamus? But a
large number of MSS. heve ‘Poscimus,' which Bentley sdopts aster Lambinus und all
the older editions. (Cruquiue, however, following his Blendinian MS, reads ‘Posci-
mur.’) With that reading the ode becomes a mere invocation 01 the Mose, which would
suit any poem or any subJect. With ‘Poecimur,' which 1 here followed most 01 the
modern editore in adopting, there ie still no clue whatever 10 the occasion of 'the ode,
and the Scholiasts' remarks do not help ue. 1 see nc grounds 101 Dilleubr.’s supposi-
tion theton some important occasion Horace was askcd tcwrite a poem, end wrote this
short ode to deprecate euch a demand, end 10 show thet hie muse was not suited to euch
themee. 1 have no doubt ‘poscimur' ie the true reading, end it mey mean merely thet
