On the outside of tha city walls, in front of Mons Esquilinus lay the Campus Esqui-
linus, in which was a public burtel-ground for the pcorcst of the people, and the place
cf execution for slaves and others of the lower sort, whose bodies were left uuburied for
the dogs and vultures to prey upon (lipod. v. 100). This place, which must always
have been a public nuisanoe anda source cimalarla, was given (as some say) bya deoree
of the senate to Maecenas, or else purchased by him, cleared, drained, and laid out in
gardens, in which he afterwards built a hendsome house (C. iii. 29. Epod. ix, xiv.
Introduction. S. ii. 3. 309). His example was afterwards followed by a member of
the house of Lamia, in where gsrdens Caligula was burded (Suet. Culig. c. 59). ⁴ 'l'he
following Satine wus suggested by a figure of Priapus set up in Maecenas' gardan. 'lhe
god is represented as contrasting the present state of the ground with what it once wns,
by which a compliment is eonveyed to Maecenas for his public spirit in ridding the
city of such a nuisunee. Priapus also complains of the trouble he has in heeping the
fflound clear of trespassers, bnt more particularly of the witches, who, having formerly
carried on their practices among the tombs and bonos of tha dead, continued to haunt
the scene of their iniquity. 'Ibis is introduced for the purpose of dragging in tha
woman whom Horace ntis-irad under the name of Canidia. The description is ln some
parte very lilre that ef the fifth lipode, aad the two may have been written about tho
same time. It is not very likely Horace would have maintained his war-fara with this
woman, vvhoerer she was or whatever her offenoe, for several years. Kirehnor (Qu.
Hor. p. 16), because in S. ii. 3. 312 reference is modo to Maecenas as engaged ln build-
ing, places these two Satires in consecutive years, this being written mdo. 721 (Intro-
duction to Epod. v.). But there is not much in this argument. The clem-ing, drain·
ing, and enclosing of tha gromm must have tuken some time, sud it may have
been several years before it was fit for living on, and no reference is made to a house iu
this Satira. Ihanlre places it in mmo. ⁷18. There isvcry little clue to the date.
