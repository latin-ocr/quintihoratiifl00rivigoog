Kuinoel supposes, with the unfortunate expedition 01 Aelius Gallus against 111 Arabiane,
though there is 10 resemblance between the ode aud the elegy, unless it may be traced
in Horaoc’s ‘pisceus nror' (v. 21). Propertius reproaches Postumus 101 leaving his
adectiouate wile Galle, whose fidelity he compares witb that 01 Penelope. 110110 sup-

all very uncertain. The odeis clearly one 0111000 towhich suy other name might bave
been prefixed, since it only deals with Horaee's ordinary eommonplsoe, the certainty of
death 1010111101. The tone is rather more melancholy than usual. Jani ehooses to
suppose that Postumus was rich, bnt covetous and seli-indulgent, afraid 01 death, and
too 001011101110110111. Dacier supposes Postumus to 10 10 01101 than Julius Plorus,

as Horace does uot in reality charge these vices upon either 01 1101110111, as will be
