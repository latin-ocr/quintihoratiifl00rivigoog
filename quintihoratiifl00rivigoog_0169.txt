OARMEN XX.

'l'his ode has none ol the appearance ιο my mind of having been written, like the last
οι the third book, lor the purpose of closing and commendinga completed work, as those
affirm who believe the flrst two books were published separately. There does not appear
ιο be any method in the arrangement oi the odes between the introductory one οι 'tha
first book and tlre last of the third (with the exception of the ilrat six of that book
which are evidently connected with oue another); aud the position of this is probably
as accidental as that of others. Tuis ode appears to have been written impromptu, and
1 think the style is mccl-heroic, or but half serious, though Horace had at least aa much
right aa others ιο commend his poctry and to be conscious ol his own powers. Various
specimens οι seli-commendation, on the part of the poete, are quoted by Dillenbr.,
beginning with Ειιιίιιι famous verses,-

“ Nemo me lacrumis decoret nec funera fletu

· Faxit. Cur i· Volito vivu’ per ora virdm.’'
1 think ‘quem vocaa’ refers to some particular invitation of Maecenas, and that the ode
was the result οι ιιιι invitation, which opinion 1 had expressed before 1 met with Dil-
lenbr.'s commenta on this ode in bis Qu. Hor. (1841, Bonn). He there treats it as an
outbarst ol yonthiul spirits on the occasiones Maecenas' first invitation (Sat. i. 6). The
epithet ‘dilecte' implying long familiarity, is opposed to this view, and Dillenbr. says
nothing about it in his edition of Horace, though hethere treats the ode aa a juvenile·
productiori. 1 do ιοι see any reason to agree with him as to that particular point.

ARGUMENT.

On a fresh strong wiug shall 1 soar to heaven far above envy und the world. Whom
thou, clear Maecenas. delightest ιο ιοιοιι, Styx bath no power ιο detain. llvcn now
my plumage is springing, aud 1 am ready ιο fly away and sing in distant places, and
to teach barbarous ιιιίοιι. No wellinge for me: away with the empty honours of
a ιοιιι.
