SATIRARUM I. 9.

SATIRE IX.

This Satire, which is justly popular for humour eud greut dramatic power, hus an
histor-ical vulne as showing, undesignedly but more clearly than almost any de-

scrssption could do, the character of Horace. It puts the men besara us as in a
pre ure.

He represents himself ae muntering alone end early ou the Socra Via, when a person

he knew no more than by neme, ο forward coxeomb, comes up fnmiliarly and felle into
conversation with him, to his grest annoyence, for he wanted ιο ιο alone and knew the
ellow's character. Horace does his best ιο shake him off, bnt he is too amiable to eope
with the effrontery of his compauion, whose objectis to get through Horace an intro·
ducticn to Maecenas, with whom the poet must therefore here been known ιο be ou
terme of intimacy et the time this Satire was written. 'l'he man's vulgarity and want
of tect are conspicuous throughout the scene ς while Horuce exhibite in every purt good
breeding and an amieble temper ; and though he is tried to the utmost by reflectione on
hia petron eud hie friends, he is incnpeble of saying a rude word, is taken off his guard
continuully, end is amusingly conacious of his inferiority to the mun of insolesce ou his
own ground. The effect of this picture is heightened by the introduction towards the
eud of the scene of Fuscus Aristius, an old friend of the poet, eud a men of the world,
who, like Horace, understood character, but had that sort of morel courege eud promp-
titude which his friend wanted. 'l'he readiness with which he tnkes np the joke eud
enters iuto Hornce's nbsurd position, und the despair to which his desertion reduces the
poet, are highly ludiorous.

prroof were wanting thet the charactersof men and the ways of the world are little
affected by the lapse of centuries, thia Satira would afford it. 1 look upon it es the
most geuiel and characteristic of ull Horace's productione. If we wanted ιο ιοηο an
estimate of the mun, I do not think we could go ιο unp othor part of his works with
more likelihood oi getting e correct oue; end his powers ns a moral satirist ere, I con·
ceive, feeble compared with his perception of, end sbility to describe, u scene of dramatic
humour like thie. If he had leit nr only this emusiug poem ιο judge by, his genius
would heve runked high, and the goodness of his nature would heve beon ecknowledged
by nil. Like our amieble poet Cowper, Horeoe appears as a satiriet of humen life und
of the vices of society; but both ure too gentle for that rcugh work, end shine most in
sesnes of quaint humour and inoffensire fun. As respects Horace st least, let any one
read thia Sutire aud judge for himself.
