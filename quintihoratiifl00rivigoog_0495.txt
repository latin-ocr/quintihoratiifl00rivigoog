SATIRE ΙΙΙ.

auc. 722.

'lhia Setire appears ιο have been written during the Saturnalia in the mouth oi De-
cember, auo. 722. In the year before, Agrippa had been Aedile, aud his Aedileship is
alluded ιο in v. 185. It was written at Horace's country house, not long, it may bc
supposed, aiter it was given him. He was impmviug the house at the timeas we may
infer from v. 808. 'l'he Setirc is general, taking in the leading vices and follius oi
humen nature-ambitium svarice, extravagance, lust, superstition, which are brought
together with some ingenuity.

One Damasippus, a man who had waeted a good fortune in speculating as anamatcur
in all sorte oi coetly articles, particularly worlrs oi ert, in which he was held ιο hes
monuissem, is introduced in a new character as a Stoic philosopher, reproving Horace
ior hie hainae, aud urging him ιο write. Hs rorte the story of hia own conversios
ιο philosophy, which was this: When he had lost all his fortune, and got hopelessly
involved with money-leudem, and found himself hughed at and called madmau where·
ever hc went, he grew desperate, and was going ιο throw himself into the liber,
when lic wus arrestsd by Stertinius, an ossele of the Stoica, who remonstrated with
him end consoled him, and at the amns time armed him agaim hia enemiee (v. 297)
with a long homily, in the course of which he proved that all thc world hut the good
and wiee wera aa mad as he wea. In thie dhcouree he enumeratas the ehici features oi
this universal madness‚ sud this forme the bulis of the Satira·

Το Damasippus a Seholiast gives tha gentile name J unius· [There was a Praetor L.
Juuioa Brutia Damasippus, who was killed no. 82 in the flght heloro the walls oi
Roma] Ernesti, in his Oluvis toCiceso, says that it was aoognomen of the Licinia gens,
and Orelli calls him Licinius Damasippum hut Cicero, who mentions him three times,
names him only Damasippus. Cicero, wishing ιο purchaaa a piece of pound on which
ιο erect a shrine ιο tha memcry of ihrllia, heard that Damasippus had some to dispose
oi on thebanis of the iiber, and commissioued Atticus to negotiate with him ior it
(ad Διι. xii. 29. 88). On another oecasiou he commissioncd e friend (Fabius Galim) to
huy him some ststnea toput in his library. He bought some which Cicero did not like,
aud thought too costly. lt appears that Damasippus had hid ior them too, and wanted
to bave them ; ior Cicero writes, “Velim maneat Damasippus iu sententia-si enim
uon manebit, aliquem pseudodamasippum vel cum jactura reperiemus '’ (ad Fam. vii.
