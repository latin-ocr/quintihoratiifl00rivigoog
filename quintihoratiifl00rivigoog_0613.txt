EPISTOLARUM Ι. 6. ·

Νιι. admirari prope res 'est una, Numici,⁴

Solaque quae possit facere et servare beatum.

Hunc solem et stellas et decedentia certia

Tempora momentis sunt qui formidine nulla

Imbuti spectent: qnid censes munere terrac,

Quid maris extremos Arabas ditantis et Indos,

Ludicra quid, plausus et amici dona Quiritis,

Quo spectanda modo, quo sensu credis et ore?

Qui timet his-adversa fere miratur eodem

Quo cupiens pacto 3 pavor est utrobique molestus; 10
, Improvise simul species exterret utrumque.

Gaudeat an doleat, cupiat metuetne, quid ad rem,

Si quidquid vidit melius pejusvc sua spe,

Defixis oculis animoque et corpore torpet?

Insani sapiens nomen ferat, aequus iniqui, 15
