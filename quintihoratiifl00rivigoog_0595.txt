lind neefnl. What uppeara to hare smack him most on hia laet perneal of the Iliad
was the reokleae eallishneea of tha leaders and their indifferenoa to tha sufferings their
petty equubbles occasioned; while the Odyeecy he jndgea ιο have been written with
the intention of representing a picture οι patiant aud wisc enduranoe in thc person oi
Ulyaaea, ιι an example to all agea Horace considers the valna οι ιιι Homeric poema
ιο lie iu tha living picturas they present to the mind; that they taught wiedom by
examples. He says nothing of the poetry and tha artistic character of these eom·
positione, in which their real merit consiste. Aa ι piace of critieiem therefore Horace’e
remarks are worth nothing. They are akin to the allegorical interpretation οι Homer
which treated hia worke ae an inexhaustible fonntain of wisdom, and orerlaid the
critical with a fauciful view. Τιιι a seuaibla man might get some good lessous from
the lliad and Odyssey is saying no more than may ba said of any werke in which
characteris drawn in eo many rarione shupea. But that the predominating impression
on the mind of a man like Horace, with good taeta and sense, atter a continuone
perueal οι Homer, should be that which ie hera given ie not easily accounted sor.
Horace had hie head fullos his new etndy of philosophy, and eaw more of practical
wiedom in these poenas than in the writings οι ιιι philosophare and sophista. ln v. 4
ha manaa to imply that Chrysippus and Crantor, aud such like philosophare, who
thought they got wiedom from Homer by refining upon him, did not know what they
were about. Their teachcr wne plain and intelligible: the fouutaiu was clear, but they
made the stream mnddy, and thebert thing ayoungman could do was to read Homer
straight through and jndge for himself. This is the best interpretation l ean put
upon Horace'e observatione, which at the beat are not of much valae, aa bearing
on tha merite of Homer.

While yon ara declaimiug ιι Rome, Lolliae, I am reading Homer at Praeneste, a
teaoher above Chrysippus and Crantor themselves. For consider, in that lliad
of hia how ha seta before us the passione of princes and people: Antenor’s saga
counael; the selfish obstinacy of Puris; Nestor mediating between angry luinge, one
inflamed with love and both with anger. The princes err, tha people suffer. Thera
ia oue scene of treaeone, stratagema, crima, luet, passion, in the Gracina camp or
within the walls oi Troy. 'l'hen again ha has given ue a bright example οι wiedorn
in Ulyeeee, driven over tha earth and sca, gothering experience ae he went, snr-
ronnded with the wavea of suffering but rising above them all, and ehunning tho
cherma οι ιιι Siren and tha aweet poieoue of Circo. Why, we are but cyphere, born
only to eat and ¹drink, like the euitare of Penelope or the people of Alcinous, who
slept and danoed and drove away aare with tha sound οι the wauton luta.
