SATIRARUM 1. 6.

saulus VI.

In addition to the obloquybrought upon him by his satiras, Horace, after his intimacy
with Maecenas was known, had ιο meet ιιι cury such good fortune was sure to excita.
His birth would furnish a handle for the enricus, ιιι ιι was probably called au upstart
and hard names of that sort. In this satire} which is nothing but ιι epistle ιο
Maecenas, he spurns the idea of his birth being any objection to him, while ιι ιιι
seme time he argues sensibly against men trying ιο get beyond their own legitimste
sphera, ιιι abning et honours which ιιι only attended with inconvenience, fatigas,
and ill will. 'l'llis satire, besides ιιι good sensa and good feeling it contains, is ιιιιιιιι
es bearing upon Horacc's life. His introduction tu Maecenas is told concisely‚ ιιι
fully ιιι with much propriety ιιι modesty; and nothing can ιι more pleasing than
the filial affection ιιι gratitudo shown in those psas that relate to his father ιιι the
education he gave him. He takes plsasure in referring whatever mariis ιι might have
to this good parent, as ιι did in ιιι fourth Satira.

'l'he Satira theu may ιι supposed ιο have been wnitten chiefly for ιιι purpose of dis-
arming euvy, by showing ιιι modesty of ιιι suthor's pretensions, and the ιιιοιιι-
stances that led to his intimacy with Maecenas. 'l'he views of public life which it
contains were no doubt iincere, and the daily routine described at ιιι ιιι was better
united ιο Ηοιιιιί ιιιίι of mind than the fatigues aud ιιιὶιιίιι of office. There is
ιιι ιιι least appearance in any of his waitings of his haung been spoilt by his good
fortune ιιι by his intercourse, on terms of rare familiarity, with Augustus, Miscenda,
ιιι otham and probably malignity never attached any one less descrving of attack
than Horace. 'lhere is uo grem vigour or variety in this picea, and its chief value is
histor-isal. Attempts have been made to fix ι dats for tha composition, but when
Franks says that because Horace declares ιι might ride ιο Tarentum if he liked on ι
mule, without attracting any notice, therefore he must lately have beeu ιι Tarentum,
and must have written thie Satine shortly after the fifth, ιιι makes his calculatione
turn chiefly on this point, it may ιι iuferred that there are no sufficient data for
forming any thing like a definite opinion οι the subject.

ARGUMENT.

'lhongh the blood of linge flcws in your edus, Maecenas, you despise not the bumbly
born, such as myself a freedman's son. lt ιιιιιιιι nothing to you who ι man's
father was, if he be but a hoamen born, knowiug wall that King Tullus, ay ιιι
many before him, though they had ιο ιιιιιιοιι, were honest ιιιι 3 while laevinus,
whose forafathers expelled the Tarquins, is not worth an as, even in the judgmsnt of
ι populace that stupidly worships ancestry. And we who are so far above thom,
how shall we judgei Allow that they prefer a Laeuium with his ancestors to ι
Decius who ιιι ιοιι, ιιι ιιιι ιιι οιιιοι might degrada one who should aspira ιο
the senate without being free born, that need not alter our judgmcnt. The censor
would act right if he did so; lat every man keep his own place. But high and low
are all willing captives following in the train of glory. What have you to do, lillius,
to ιιιιιιι your tribuneship and your badgei Yon are only drawing more envyon
your hcad. The moment a man pute on a senator's dress, ‘⁸ Who is this i” says one.
‘⁶ Who was his fatheri” says another. aa ιιι fop who likes to be thought lrsndsome
snakes all the girls curicus to examine his features, his anolo, his foot, his tceth, his
hair, so the placeman hears ou all harada, “Who was his father? what was his
mother? What you, tha son of a slave, ιο you take upon yourself to put citizens to
