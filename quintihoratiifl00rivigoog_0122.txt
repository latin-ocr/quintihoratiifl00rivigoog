nuc. 715 (v. 16), and betoola himself 10 literature, but 00011001 himself at first chiefly
to dramatis writing. It appears from Suetonius (de Illust. Gram. c. 10) 1101 10 did not
undertalae his history till alter tho death of Sallust, 0010. 720 (see Clinten, F. Η. a.
39 nc), for it was aiter that event that he 1000000 acquaiated with the grammarian
Atteius, who lirrnislrcd him with rules for composition. And 11110 history was not
begun till 1101 year, cren though (as is probable) Pollio should hare talren 00100 01 most
01 the transactione 10 had to relate, with a great many 01 which he had been personslly
connected, it is 001 probable that so large u work, consisting 01 serenteeu books, und
taking in the whole period 100ιο the coalitiou 01 Caesar, Pompeias, and Crassus to 110
conclusion 01 the civil wars, could hare been so far eompleted aa to be conanunicated
to hir friends beiore 110 year 0010. 723, which was the year of 110 battle 01 Actium.
But the words “arana nondum expiatis uncta cruoribus '' (v. 4 sq.)‚ coupled with
“cni dabit partes scelus expiandi J uppiter '' (C. 1. 2. 20 sq.), uralre it likely that these
two odes were written about 110 sume time 3 that is to say, shortly aster the battle and
before Augustus lind established his gorernment in the conlidenee of the people. It is
true lambinus aad some 01 110 older commentators were 01 opinion that the history
01 Pollio is not 010001, 101 only his tragedies‚ which they say related 10 110 eventa 01
110 times, 001 which Horace wishes him 10 lay asidc for a while aud give his attention
to public affairs, until the republie should be settled. So they interpret
- ‘¹ mox ubi publicas
Res ordinaris grande munus
Cecropio repetes cothurno.”

But there is 00 reason 10 suppose any 01 Pollio’e tragedies had reference 10110 events
01 110 day, while his history related 10 nothing else. The Scholiasta understood the
history to ba referred 10 (seo uote cn v. 10).

The ode was written after hearing Pollio recito part 01 110 werla; apraetice which
he is said 10 hare introduced among literar-y men at Rome.

ARGUMENT.

The civil ware, their causes, their 100110, their progress, the sports 01 fertum, and the
fatal leugues 01011010, 001 arms strained with blood not yet atoned for—u dangcroua
taah is thiae, and treacherons is· the ground thou art trcading.
