654 HORA'FII FLACCI

judgment in respect ιο deceased und living authors, the former of whom they eora-
mended only because they were dead and gone, while the latter they abused through
ouvy und spite. There is something in this complaint which corresponds with his
censure of Lucilius aud his admirere written many years before. But Lucilius does not
appear in this poem, in which the drumatic writers are those more particularly notited.
lt appears that Augustus was very partial ιο these himself, and Horace probably mesas
indirectly ιο remonstrate with the emperor's teste iu this mutter, and to put in a pla
1 for himself and his brothton, though that this was not necessary is plain from sugnens
generositytoVirgil and Varius, noticcd inv.235‚ und from the intimacy on the strength
of which he was enabled to write ιο the great man at all in this strain. 'l'he parts uf
the Epistlc do not hang together very closely, especially aster the first uiuety lines
They oonsist of compliments to Augustum a remonstrance about the patrumge
bestowed on the old pocts; a description of the rspid growth of art in Graece after the
Persian war ; a complaiut that every body at Roma has taken tc writing versem a
commendationes pocta as good aud useful citizens and contributors to the ustional
piety 3 a history of the growth of poetry in ltnly3 a comparison between tragady aul
comedy, aud a sucer at Plautus and another-3 an account of the troubles ot' drsrustir
authors through the caprice und bad teste of their eudieuce, which at that time is
stated ιο have been especially depraved3 uu appeal ιο Augustas on behalf of the poste
of the day; aud u reproof to such poete as are uureasouable or officione, and attempt
themes too exulted for them.

How much foundation there may have been for Horace’s remarks about the compara·
tivo support given ιο the old writers aud the new it is hard ιο say. there appears ιο
bc a little contradiction between this alleged neglect end the universal ruge for serit·
bling which he describes r or else the profusior of bad verses may itself account for
tho preference of those, who did not write, for the genius of former days. Horace has
not a word ιο say for Plautus or for Terence, but rather suaers at the popularjudgmt
of them. We may safely say therefore that this Epistle is worth nothing iu paint
of criticism, aud that it does not raiae Horace very high as a guida to the tute of
others. It is possible au affectation of preference for the archaia in language may
have prevailed in some quartcrs3 but Horace’s censure affectu those who on round
principles of taste preferred the vigour of the old writers to the weakncss of the ner.
ln short, there is no discrimination in his statement of the caser in which thereforel
do not find it easy to follow him.

There is much polish iu the versificatiou of this Epistle. The dettcry with which is
opens is cleverly written, aud the verses towards the end, in which Horace compendien-25
states the military successes of Augustus, are terse and elegant. His commendatior
of the poet is a fair tribute tohis own profession. 'lhe description of thevulgar raas
for spectacles is natural, aud reminds us of our own tirnes; and there is enough in the
Epistle ιο account for the high estimation it is held iu by the general reader.

ARGUMENT.

lt would be unpardouable in me to detsiu you, 0 Caesar, absorbed as you are iu tlre
weightiest cares. Romulus and Liber, the sons of laeda audiissemus, those hene
factore of mankind, received not while alive the honour dne ιο their great doech:
they were euried theu, but are worshipped uow, for greatness scorches those hebra

we render our homage, oven while you ure with us, aud scknowlcdge that your equal
hus not been, aad never shall be.
