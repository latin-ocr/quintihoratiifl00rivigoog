EPODON LIBER, 5. 287

Interminato eum semel fixae eibo
Iutabuissent papulae.

Non defuisse masculae libidinis
Ariminensem Foliam

Et otiosa eredidit Neapolis
Et omne vicinum oppidum,

Quae sidera excantata roae Thessala 45
Lunamque caelo deripit.

Hie irreseotum saeva dente livido
Canidia rodens pollicem

Quid dixit aut quid tacuit? Ο rebus meis
Non infideles arbitrae, 50

Nox et Diana quae silentium regis

Nune, nuno adeste, nune iu hostiles domos

Formidolosis dum latent silvis ferae 55
Duloi sopore languidae,

Senem, quod omnes rideant, adulterum
Latrent Suburanae canes
