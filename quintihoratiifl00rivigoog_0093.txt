CARMINUM Ι. tt.

GARMEN XXV.

Resides thie there are two other odes (iii. 15. iv. 13), the subject oi which isthe wan·
tonness of faded boentioe, a subject probably handled with still greater pungency by
Archilochus, for it was onehis smcasm would dnd scope in end wouldbe likelyto fasten
upon. It is impossible to say whether Horsoe hed any individual in his mind when he
wrote any oi these odes. Ifhe had, we need not go ιιι-ιιιιι· and suppose that he wrote
as a disappointed lover. For instance, Jani'e indignerim st the virulence with which
Ησιιιοιοιιι findit in his hesrt to ettack (0. iv. lt) the women he was so fond of (C. ιιι. 9)
seems to he meoeesary. But it is a fair specimen of thet matter-cidem school os in-
terpretation. Ihave before had οοοιιιοιι ιο remark, how the seme principle is applied
to Lydia end how many new lights she appears in (O. 13. Introduction).

lust, to cry for lovers, and complain thet young blood goes efter the tendor plant and
hide the old leavee go iioet upon the Hebrus.
