Licinius Murena, or A. Terentius Varro Murena, as he was called after hia adoption
by A. Terentius Varro, was apparently a man of restless aad ambitione character, and,
newa bave seen, paid the penalty of his rsshness with bis life (C. ii. 2, Introduction). Itis
very probabis that Horace wrote this ode to his friend to warn him of the mudeucies of
bis disposition. au elsethntwe learn from Horace's pocmsrespecting Murenais that he
was of the college of augura (C. iii. 19), end that he had abousc at Formiae, where he
* received Maecenas aud his party on their way ιο Brundusium (S. i. 5. 37 sq.). As
Murena was put ιο death auc. 732 or 731, this ode must heve becu written before
that year. , ⁴

Although it may be infers-ed from the tone of this ode that Murena was uot incapeble
ol the conduct imputcd ιο him and ou the charge οι which be died, bis guilt does not
appear to have been proved. Dion (54.1. 3) saysthat ⁴‘ in the year when Μ. Marcellus
and L. Arruntius were consule, Fannius Caepio bendcd a conspiracy, which was joined by
otbers; and Murena was said to bave entered into it with them, either sna or elaa-
dercaaly. 'l'he conspirators did not appear ιο take their· trial, and were condemned in
their absence, but were taken and put ιο death shortly afterwards. Proculeius, his
brother, aud Maecenas, who had married his sister, were unable to obtain Mureua's
pardou.” 'lhe same historian charges him with ungovernable aad indiscriminate rnehness
of speech: ὄκράτφ aal κατοκορεῖ radiasse πρὸς sternutatione ἐχρῆτο (bie 3). [Comp.
Velleius, ii. 91 5 Sueton- lib. ο. 8.]
