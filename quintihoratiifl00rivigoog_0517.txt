SATIRARUM II. 3. 481

Huic vestem, ut gnatae, peret ancillae, paret aurumi 215
Rufum aut Pusillam appellet fortique marito
Destinet uxorem 3 interdicto huic omne adimat jus
Praetor et ad sanos abeat tutela propinquos

Vincet enim stultos ratio insanire nepotes,
Hic simul accepit patrimoni mille talenta,
Edicit piscator uti, pomarius, auceps,
Unguentarius ac 'lusci turba impia vici,
