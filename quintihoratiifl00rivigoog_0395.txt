SATIRARUM 1. 3.

Abjecto instrumento artis clausaque taberna,
Sutor erat, sepiens operis sic optimus omnis
Est opifex solus, sic rex. Vellunt tibi barbam
Lascivi pueri 3 quos tu nisi fuste coerces,
Urgcris turba circum te stante miserque-
Rumperis et latras, magnorum maxime regum.
Ne longum faciam: dum tu quadrante lavatum

Rex ibis neque te quisquam stipator ineptum
Praeter Crispinum sectabitur, et mihi dulces
Ignoscent si quid peccaro stultus amici,
Inque vicem illorum patiar delicta libenter,
Privatusque magis vivam te rege beatus.
