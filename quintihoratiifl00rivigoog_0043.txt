CARMINUM Ι. 2.

ΟΑΒΜΕΝ ΙΙ.

ane. 725. ¹

'l'his ode was probably written ou the return of Caesar Octurienus [named Augustus,
mc. 27] to Rome, atter the taking of Alexandria, when the civil wers were ended, end
the temple of J onus was shut, nmo. 725. Horace expresses the opinion which Tacitus
(Anu. i. 9) states was held by reflecting men of ell parties, “uon uliud discordantis
patriae remedium fuisse qunm ut ab uno regeretur,'' that the only remedy left for the
troubles efthe state wes en absolute government in the hands of one person. lde has
been charged with desertiug his republican principles, and even urging the destruction
of those whose party he hed once belonged to, and with whom he had fought ut Philippi.
But Horace urges reform, not bloodshed3 and he hud'lived long enoughto scethet reform
wne not to be expected at the hands of republican leaders, or from any but him whose
genius wus now in the escendunt. lt is not therefore in any· mean spirit thut he urges
Octarisum to take upon himself the teet of reducing to order the elemento of tbc
state, which so many years of civil war hud thrown into confusion-Neue of Horece's
odes are more justly celebrated than this for the imagery it contains, for ite genuine
feeling, and for the dclicecy with which it liuttere Octavianus, inserting him with divine
attributes, but inviting him to exorciso them us a father correcting end defendiug his
children, and thus to evenge in tlre noblest manner his great-unclc's murder. The
way in which he introduces the neme of Caesar uuexpectedly et the end bas always
appeared to me en instance of consummate art. ·

'lhe prodigies described at the beginning of this ode are those which were ssid to have ι

followed the death of G. Julius caesor. They are related ulso by Virgil, Georg. i. 466-
489, which passage, and the verses-that follow it to the endef the book, shouldberecd in
connexion with this ode. It will appear to uny render of both very probable that Horace
had this description iu his mind when he wrote. It bus been thought thet Horuce could
not hove referred to prodigies which hed occurred so long before (ae-0. 710, fifteen years
before this ode was written), when he was at Athens, and therefore could not have
witnessed them. Other prodigies therefore hare been mumcd es the subject of these
opening staurus. But the only other occasions, ebout this time, when the 'fiber is
recorded to bave orertlowed its bunlrs, were nmo. 727 und 782, the earliest ef which
years would be too luto for this ode, in which the allusione to the stete of Rome and
the triumphs of Augustus (v. 49), and the proposal thet he should cmume supreme
authority, would in that cose have been out of date und unnccessary. One of the
chief purposes professed by Augustus was the ussnging of his adoptive father's death ς
sec Suet. Octur. mr “Nihil convenientius ducens quum necem avunculi vindicare
tuerique scta.” Tacitus eleo speshs of him (Anu. i. 9) us “pietate erga parentem—
ad arma civilio sctum ;'' which his enemies turned against him, seying, “Cassii et
Brutorum exitus paternis inimicitiis detes, quenquam fus sit privetu odia in publicis
utilitatibus remittere.” According to Dion cassius (liii. 4) his declared purpose wer
ὅπως τῷ rs πατρὶ δεινῶς coppim τιμωρῆσαι καὶ τὴν πόλιν ἐκ μεγάλων sel ἐπαλλήλων
κακῶν ἐξελέσθαι. Orid (rus. v. 57³, sqq.) introduces him es uttering this prayer
to Mure: '

“ si mihi bellandi pater est Vestaeque sacerdos
Auctor, ct ulcisci numen utrumque paro t
Mure, ades et satie scelerato sanguiue ferrum,
Stetque favor causa pro meliore tuus.
Templa feres et me victore vocaberis ultor.'’

'lhls being the cese, Horace could not judicibusly have passed over the death of C. J ullus
