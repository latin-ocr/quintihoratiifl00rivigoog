ace 0. iv. 7. Introduction. Τιο occasion was the erening before maara birth-day
(v. 9), which Porphyrion says means 0. J nlius Caesar. llis birthday was on the 1ath
duly, and this ‹linner was giren in the summer (v. 11). But the name Caesar pat
absolutely could only apply ιο Augustus at this time, and Corum. Cruq. differs from the
other Scholiest, and says rightly it must bare been the birth-day of Augustus, which
was the eard of September. The expression ‘matina' does not accurately correspond
to that time, for autumn began the day before ιιο Idea ol September. But that ia not
very important. 'Ibe beat is never so oppressiva as in September in a warm elimata.

ol this child was celebrated by making the day a perpetual festival (Dion cassim 54.
