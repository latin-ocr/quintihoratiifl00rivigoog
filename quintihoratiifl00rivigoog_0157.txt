Alter nuo. 720.

'lhere are no means of firing the date of this ode. It. was written, however, alter
Horace 11011 come into possession of his farm, to which he refers (v. 37). The person
Pompeius Grosphus, to whom the ode is addressed, was, according to Porphyrion, 01 tha
equestrian order. He possessed large property in Sicily, of which island he was pro·
hably a native. On his return Horace gave him a letter of introduction to his friend
Iccius (lipp. 1. 12), 111 which he speaks highly of his worth. Cicero mentions u Sicilian
Eubulidas, who bore the surname of Grosphus, a man of high character und birth, and
great wealth (in Verr. 11. 3. 23). 'iletre supposes (p. 473) that this Grosphus was made
a Roman citizen by Cn. Pompeius, 0111110011 his name, which descended to Horaca's
friend, his 101101 grandson. He is not 10 be confounded (as Jani and others confound
him) with the Pompeius of C. ii. 7 (Introduction). He appears, from the latter part of
the ode, to have been in Sicily when it was written. Perhaps he had written Horace a
letter which called up the particular traines thought that runs through the ode, or had
qualities which made it applicable to him.
