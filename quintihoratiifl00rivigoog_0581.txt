LIBER PRIMUS. ’

‚ assason Ι.

Sosis tima aster Horace had puhliahedhis three books oi* odes, and had, usit appears, α
laid asido that sort of wrhing, lt seems that Maecenas, und probably his other friends,
beggsd him ιο return to it. That is ιιο obvious meaning of the remonstrencc avith
which the Epistle opens. Ηο expresses an comest wish ιο retire into privacy, ιο abau-
don poetry, aud to devote himself ιο ιιο study of philosophy. He discluims all con·
nerion with secta, and professes in all humility, but not without some irony, ιο follow
his own crude notione asa mare beginncr; his hope and purpose, he says, is ιο carry
virtue into active practice, as that which “Aeque pauperibus prodest, locupletibus
aeqne;'’ he recommends it as ιιο panacea ciliis, as ιιο only trus wisdom ; he looks
npon the world aa a shuffling scena oi inconsistency, and men’s judgments as shallow
and vulgar3 harven charges his petron himself with the prcrailing lerity.

We may infer frorn all this that Horace, who knew the world pretty weil, and whose
risehae not been free from many veratium, arising out of the jesieusies his popularity
und his writings had occasioned, would have been glad ιο retiretohis books and his rc·
flectione, not, as some have said, ιο ιιο study οι philosophieal systema, i'or all oi which .
1 believe ιο had a contempt iu hie beart, as ιο cannot help showing even in his short
summary at the end ofthis Epistle3 the climax of his sermon on virtum an irresistible
jokc at the expense of the Stoics, the most rigid though not the most practical advo·
cates cf virtue. Whutever news Horace had in respect ιο goodness and happiness were
his own: aud we cen believe that cuc who had such perceptione οἰ ιιο follies and vices
· oi ths world was sincere in wishing to get away from it; that he was tired of a reputa·
tion which broughthim into trouble3 and that he was weary of waiting versesto express
aposaion ιο never heartily leit and was stili less lihcly to feel in his iorty-ilith year. Hs
did return ιο Ode writing, as are know, and wrote some oi his best verses (ιιι not his
best love verses) long atter he had pleadcd his exemption with Maecenas. When this
Epistie was written ia not ιο ιο traccd by any incidentai allusione, and we usu only
suppose it was scura tirno aiter the publication citha odes, which was not earlier thau
amc. 730. The year 734 is assumed with some probability by lhanlrs.
