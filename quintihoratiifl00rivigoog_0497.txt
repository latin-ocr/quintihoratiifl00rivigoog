who knew nothing of music, awls and laets who was no shoemsher, sails who was αο

your wife, cr poison your mother, and you are all right, because you are no Orestes
of Argos but a gentleman cf Rome. But was not Orestes mad before he betrayed
it by murdering his mother? And efter that he did nothing worse than yourselt'.
Opimius the miser was sicis. and nigh unto death. llis heir was exulting in the

'lhen says the doctor, ‘If γοα don’t take care, your heir will carry off all your

(r. 166.) “ lt males no difference whether you throw away your money or iorbear to
