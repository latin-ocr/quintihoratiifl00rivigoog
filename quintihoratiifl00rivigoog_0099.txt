CARMINUM Ι. 28. 63

though most even of these who divide ιιι oolloquy at v. 6 heve overlooked this diffi-
culty, and aoeepted ‘te' on the authority of the MSS. But ‘nauta’ is οοι properly a
common sailor, but ‘msicularim' a shipmester. “ N autam accipere debemus eum qui
ueram marcet: quamvis ιιιιιι appellantur omnes quinaria navigandus οιιιι in nave
sunt. Sed de exercitare solummodo Praetor sentit '’ (Dig. 4. 9. 1. 5 2). Τιι ‘exercitur’
is the person who charters the ship. There does not seem ιο ιι any natural division et
s. 16, and forArchytas to begin (ιι v. 21) with ‘Me qnoque deveri,' doc, nothing
having gene before with which ιο οοοοιιι ιιοιι words, is slso unnature13 while, if we
understand himtobeginhis reply at ‘Sed omnes uua manet nox,' we have sn opposition
between tha sarcssm of the first speaker (who says irenically oi those ιιιι aspired to
mnnexion with the gods and ιο ιιι highest order of wisdom that they had not escaped
death, not asan Pythagorae, though be pretended ιο have done ιο once) and ιιι grave
truth, solemnly proponnded by the philosopher, that all must die, wiso sud unwise, old
sad young, on land er ιι ιιι, and illustrated by his own casa. 'I'his was once my
opinion, and as many will still adhere tothe theory of the dialogos and Archytas' ship-
wreek, I have put that theory inwhat appears to me the best form. The other expla-
nation of the ode, however, I feei little doubt, is in the main the true oue. Another, to
which Orelli inclined (though he suspended his judgmcnt on ιιι whole question), sup-
poses asailer coasting along the Apulian shore and seeing the tomb of Archytas, where·
upon he breaks out into the address ‘Te maris? doc„ from s.1to 20. Thon the ghoat
os ι lately shipwreeked man eomes forward and prays for a little send. It would be
difficolt ιο imagine any circumstances that could have suggested such ι ιοιοι, especially
withso abrupt achange of persons. 'ibe sudden apparition oia ghost eohoing back to
ιιι marines ιι ιιι his own words ιο my mind appears almost ludicrous.

One difficulty appears to ms ιο be fatal ιο ιιι notion oi a dialogus, and that is con-
tsincd in the second and third venes, in which it appears to be clearly intimated that
the body ot Archytas bas already received that which be is supposed so earnestiy ιο
prsy for: fer though many, 1 am awers, get oser this difficulty by supposing ‘cohibent
muners' ιο ιοιιο ιιιι ιιι want os the scanty gito oi a little earth was keeping him
back from his rest, 1 do not sae how the words will bear that semer nor ean 1 translate
‘cohibent' with Dillenbr. end others, as if it was meant that his body occupied but ι
small space en ιιι surfaee ei the ground. 'l'he worda can only mean that hewse under
ιιι ssnd, whether partially or otherwise, aad iu either cese he would not require duat
ιο ιι cast three times on him.

This consideration, aswell as the unity and simplicity it gives to the edebas induced
ms, with much oeutidenoe, to adopt the explanation I bave given 'dhe propriety of a
sea-farlng person being appealed te consiste in his being exposedto risis os ιιι same
fate with tha person who appeals ιο him.

ARGUMENT.

Esau thee, thou moesurer of earth and aea, thou connter of ιιι sanda Archytas, how
small a portion of earth οοοιιιοι ιιιι now! It predts thee not to bave soerched ιιι
sir aud traversed the haerens since thou wart ιο dis. So Tantalus, Tithonus, and
Minos have died, aud Pythagoras toowith all his learning heth gone down once more
ιο ιιι greve. But so it is: eli must die aliha 5 some to make apert for Mars, some
mllowed up in the deep= old and young go crowdiug to the grave: noue escape: I
too have par-iahed in the wetere.¹ But grudge me not, thou marines, abandiul ot
earth: so may the sturm spond itaelt on the woods while thou art saie and thy mer-
chandiaa increases. ls it a small matter with thee to bring ruin on thy children?
Yes, perhaps retributicn awaita thyself ι my eones will be heard, and than no atone·
ment shall deliret thee. ’'l’is but the work οι ι moment-thrice cast earth upon me
aud huten en.
