(v. 153.) If you went your pisy ιο sucoeed you must study the characters of
different agesr your child must be thoughtless end plsyfuh your youth fond oi
merely sporte, *open ιο temptation, intolerunt oi advice, improvident, seph-ing, end
flckle; your full-grown man must be cautious, looking for money end friends end
sdvsneemeutc while your old msn is surroundsd with troubles, evsricious, nervous,
cold, procrastinstlng, slow ct* hope, sluggish, greedy of lile, morose, querulous,
commending the former days, s reprover of youth. For sear theu ol mixing up the
dill'ereut periods of life, we should lix attention upon the cbemcteristics oi each.

(v. 179.) The events most either pess upon the stege, cr be told citer they ure orer.
What is seen mskes more impression than what is heurd 3 but still horrore and incre·
dible mervels sre not to be transacted on the stage. Δ play should be in five sets.
No god should be brought in without necessity. No fourth person shouldbe allowed
to speuk. The chorus should second the speakers, snd should not sing whst is irrele-
vant. lt should favour end counsel the good, eahn the passionete, commend
temperence, justice, obedience ιο the lawr, and peece; keep secrete aud offer prsyers
to the gods for mercy to the efflicted sud vsngeenoc on the tyrsnt.

(v. 202.) Once the dote wss s phin uehemens mede l'or the use ol* the chorus, end not
ιο llll great thestres, es now. But this simple music changed when conquest and
luxury mixed up country sud town. 'lheu the flete-pleyer strutted on the stage,
und the lyrc wos tuned ιο solemn sounds, ιο pessiouete eloqueuce, or oraculur atrains.

(v. 220.) Soon after 'liegedy cume the Satyris Drama, when fun sud grevity were
separated, and the spectator-s in the licence of the honr were treated with fresh jokes
sndnoveltics. But in these plays too there must be no inconsistenciee, such es eged
or hero coming down to trivere-slung or lesing himself in fustion. Tragedy should
move like s modest and stetely metron among the Satyrs. For 1 would not hanish
tragic lungunge altogether, so thet Silenus the god should talk in the some struiu
ss stus the slave. l would udopt e familiar style, so thet any one should think he
could do it es well till he came to try. l'suns must neither telk like city besor nor
use low lengusge, lest they offend the better sort, though the vulger incy applaud.

(v. 251.) Asbort syllable followed by along make su lembus, the ropidity οι· which
msde the securim pusssor s trimeter. Δι tirst sll the feetwcre iambi, till to give
more stesdiness ιο the verse spondees were admitted in the uneven feet. Accius aod
Ennius nearly bunished the ismbus altogether. 'lhis is s blot in them, but it is not
every one thst cen tell good versification from bed. Shull l presume upon this? or
shsll I write csutiously, ss il every fuult would bs detectedi 'I'hus might 1 cscspe

(v. 268.) Tuke the Greeks for your models snd study them.

Why, your isthers used to admire both the rhythm sod the wit oi Plautus.

Yes, stupidly enough, if we know the didereuce between cosrscness end wit, and can
scan a verse.

(v. 276.) Thespisis ssid to heve invented Trsgedy, trevelling about with his weggon,
end his actore smeered with wine lees. 'rhen cerne Aeschylus with mesk, robe,
cothurnus, end stege, sud teught them to speak grundly. Alter these the old
comedy, which wer highly approved, till lieence wss sbused, end the lew stepped in
and silenced the chorus. Our poete hove been bold enough sometimes to quit the
Greek and celebrate home tolcs in tregedy und comedy, und il' they were more diligent,
Latium would be es mighty in literature ss in urms. Oh! my friends, heve nothing
ιο say ιο u poem which does not show merke oi core end correction.
