CARMINUM 1. 3.

OARMEN III.

The date os this ode has been much discussed. lt istho chronologists' stumbliug-
bloels. If it was written οο ιιο occasiones that voyage to Athens stom which Virgil
only returned ιο die, the date must be suc. 735. llovv that interseras with the
rechoniug of Franks and others may be soen by referring to ιιο introductory remarks
ιο this edition l'ranka however denies that this ode has reference ιο that voyage.
He eren thinks it doubtful whether it ia addressed to Virgil the poet; and though he is
in general very acute andjudicious, his real for the theory he advocates ran away with
his jndgusent when it led him to think that Quintilius, whose death islsmented in C. 24
οι· this bools, is the person here addressed, aad that perhaps ιο was drowned on tha
voyage, since it is clear, says he, from that ode that he met with an untimely aud vio·
lent death. Comiug from most other people this theory wcu'ld not be worth mentioning.
'l'hat it isthc rasortof an advocate indifficultyis cleur on the face of it. He thiale these
two odes are closely connected, though the link has been lost tous hom the obscurity of
the allusione, but ιο finds ο traca ol it in ιιο words “Navis quae tibi creditum Debes '⁸
(v. 6 ol this ode); aad (l. 24. 11, “Tu frustra pius heu! non ite creditum.’' 'l'here is no
weight in thie argument at all ς ncvertheless, there is no certainty that the ode was
written ou tho occasion supposed. Virgil may have made or contemplatad a voyage
before his last, and there is so much difficulty attending the date aue. 735 that I am
inclined to think such must hare been the case. ‘lhis leaves the date of the ode in
uncertainty. Frnnle's best argument is, that if the publication of these odes took place
aster Virgil’s death, it usust have been immediately or very soon after, even according
to ιιο chronology of Kirchner and others who are opposed tc him3 und that it would
have been iu the worst teste and feelingto have inserted this ode et such atime. There
can be little doubt, I think, but hewould have suppressed it, or accompauied it with one
exprmsing his own and the universal sorrow. Icannot imagine agrester mcckery than
the insertiones an ode addressed to Virgil on the death ofhis friend, and en ode praying
for his sese voyage, at a time when all Virgil’s friends must heve been bewailing his
death, to which no allusion is made in any part ol Hcrace's writiugs. 'lhis last fact
would ιο accouuted for it' we supposed Vis-gil to have died during the time when Horace
had almost if not entirely suspended this kind of writiug. anko's attempt ιο show
that there was οοι ιιοι mutual affection between Virgil and Horace which would warrant
the expressions in this ode isvery wealr. But others have affirmed the same because
Virgil nowhere mentions Horace, aud ιοοοοοο ιο did not leave him his literary executor,
but eliose Varius and 'l'ucca rather thau Hamae. But Virgil leit his AEncid not to ιο
published but destroyed, aud there is no reason why he should heve chosen Horace ior
such a purpose. Δ man may heve more friends than executore, and does not always gire
that office ιο ιιοοο ιο loves beet. As for the other argument, if tha nature σι’ Virgil’s
poema ιο considered, it is not worth noticing.

Compare with this ode Statiue’ ‘Propempticon' to Metius Celer, ‘a most noble aud
pleasant youth,' whom as he could not accompany hesent upon his way with abeautilul
address, suggested partly it would οοοοο by this of Horace (Silr. iii. 2).
