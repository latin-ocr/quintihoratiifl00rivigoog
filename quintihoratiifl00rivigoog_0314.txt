278 HORA'PII FLACCI

Aut herba lapathi prata amantis et gravi
Malvae salubres corpori,

Vel agna festis caesa Terminalibus,
Vel haedus ereptus lupo.

Videre fessos vomerem inversum boves
Collo trahentes languid0‚

Positosque vernas, ditis examen domus,
Circum renidentes Lares!

Haeo ubi locutus fenerator Alphius,
J am jam futurus rusticus,

Omnem redegit Idibus pecuniam,
Quaerit Kalendis ponere.
