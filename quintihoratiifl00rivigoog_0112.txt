¹When Augustus was meditating an expedition against the Britons and another 101
the East, Horace commended him 10 the care 01 Fortuna the praeeram, as Pindar oom-
mitted the sons 01 Himera:

Λ1σσομαι, sai Ζηνὸς Ἐλευθερίου,

Ἱμέραν εὐρυσθένέ ἀμφιπόλει, Σύτειρα Τύχα·

τ1ν γὰρ ἐν πόντῳ κυβερνῶνται θοαὶ

νᾶες, ἐν χέρσῳ δὲ λαιψηροὶ πόλεμοι

κάγορα1 βουλαφόροι. (Olymp. xii.)
Which passage probably Horace had in mind. The last expedition against Britain eon-
tsmplated by Augustus was 1110. ’127 (Dion (lass. ts. 22-25), which was interruptedby
au insurrection 011110 Salassi, an Alpina people, ἐς τὴν Βρεταννῐιιν ἐπειδὴ μὴ ἠθέλησαν
ὁμολογῆσαι οτριιτευσείοντιι κατέσχον oi Σαλόσσιοι. at the same time 1101111 preparing

composition 01 this oda may be assigned.

The oldest temples 01 the goddess Fortuna ware at Rome, where 110 leam 110111
Plutarch (on the Fortuna 01 the 1101011110.1.),τὰτῆςΤύχης ἱερὰ πάμπολλα aad παλαιὰ
κο1λιμπρᾶ τιμαῖς πάσαις ὥς ἔπος εἷπεῖν &liparas ιεα1 καταμέμιιιται τοῖς &spassand-
τοις μέρεσι aal τόποις riis πόλεως. 'l'he oldest 011101 temples was dedicated to Fortuna
Virilis by Aucus Martius (Plutarch says). There was another to Fortuna Muliebris,
founded in commemorationes the victory 01 Coriolanus' mother over her son ς and
Servius Tullius founded two on the Capitoline hill 10 Fortuna Primigenia and Fortuna
Obsequens; on tha Palatina hill thera avere two to Fortuna Privata and Fortuna Viscosa.
'Fhere was also a Fortuna virginalis aad a Fortuna Bonae Spei, a Fortuna Mascula,

πράγματα. But the worship 01 this goddess was most solemnly maintained, when
Horace wrote, at Praeneste and at Antium (now Porto d'hnzo), where she had an oracla.
'l'he 11010111 conception 01 this divinity was probably different from that 01 tha Greeks,
who thought 01 her chiefly as 1 0101101011 goddess and blind. But that such was not
the only idea 01 laer even among the Greeks is plain 110111 Pindar's ode above quoted.
Pindsr in other 0001111 now lost described her aa φερέπολις, tha supportet 01 statas 3 11110
aa one 01 the Μοῖραι, and the most power-ful 01111οι11 ς but elsewhere as ἀπευθὴς, uncer-
tain, unknown 3 in which character casual altars were created to her by the Greeks as
dyraaror Osis. See St. Paal'a address to the Atheniens iu Acts xvii. 23 ς also Pausa-
nias, ir. ³0, vii. 26; and Plutarch's Treatise abore mentioned, caps. 41111 10. From
Plutarch’s account aha 11011111 appear to be the one divinity held 110111 tha earliest times
