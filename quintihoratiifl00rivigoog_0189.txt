74. luridam] For the menningo of this lus make Typhon or Typhoeus the offender
word, which is perhaps a contractiori of onwhom Aetna was laid. Callimachus as·

'fhers would seem ιο have been generally prevalent a feeling of soreness and im·
patience under the disgruee, so long unredccmed‚ of the reversos sustained in Asia by
the Roman arms under M. Crassus und M. Antonium and this feeling it appears ιο ιο
Hor-ace's purpose in thisode to olley, und ιο discoursge any hope or desire for the return
of the Parthian prisoners. This desire Horace seems to impute to a degenerate spirit,
sud the story uf Regulus is introdueed apparently to cell buch meu’s minds to the
standard of a former genereticn. An honouruble death, he tells thern, is better than a
dishononrable slavery, and u unusne fame is more to be cured for than personui ssfety.

Τιο usual inscriptions, “ In laudem Caesaris Augusti,'' ‘⁸ Ad divum Augustum,” ιο,
do not represent the purport of the ode, though it is introduced with a huttering
prophecy of the emperorfs success in the expedition he had probably just entered upon,
which was that noticed in the lust ude.

ARGUMENT.

add ruin to shame: the dyed wool recovers not its fair colour 3 and sorirtue oncelost
cares not to be restored. When the freed hind fights the captor, the prisoner relensed
shall eope again nith his foe, he who has cried for mercy und made peuce for himself
on the battle-field: Oshsme! OOurthnge, exalted on the full of Rome !’' Thon ho
put away his wife and his children; and fixed his eyes upon the ground, strengthened
