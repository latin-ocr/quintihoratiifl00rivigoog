CARMEN XVII.

Franks eonsiders thieto be the latest of the Epodes, written with the ironica] pur·
pose of making peaes between the poet aad Canidia, whom he had so unmereifully
lampooned, before the publication ef the poema in whieh she figures. Certainly the
meantatiunis not less severe than the diatribae. Ι do not think it necessary or feasible
ιο asslgn it s date, and am not disposed ιο agree with those who from v. 2³, ‘¹ 'l'uls
capillus albus est odoribus,” infer that this Epode was not written, and therefore the
book was not puhliahed, till Horaee was advaneed in years, or till alter the composition
osc. iii.14(s.u.o.'f290r730)‚ ιοοοοοο there ho says his hair is beginning to tarn
gray. If hia hair was perfeetly blaek, it would only enhaueethe satire of the above
assertion. Τιο whole subject of this quamel (as might be expected) is so obseura that
it is useless to offer any conjectures upon it; but no one, I think, ean read this Epode
and suppose that the affair was altogether fictitious. There is too much vigour and
¹genial humour in these verses to admit of sach s notion. Admitting therefore the .
eriatenee in some shape of Canidia, I only deprecate the inferentes derived from a ιοο
literal interpretation of particular expressions, as notieed in the former odes referring ιο
this same woman (ΕΡ, iii. 8ο. ; r. Introd. ιο).

ARGUMENT.

I yield, I yield,· Ι pray thee by Proserpina, by Diana, bythiae own mighty spella,
Canidia, eease thy eharms; stay, stay thy wheel. Achilles had eompassion upon
Telephus, and healed him. He was entreated and gare back the body of Hector, and

¹ the matrone of 'lhoy anointed him for burial. Ciroe restored the eompanions of
Ulysses. Surely Ι have been punished enough, O thou that art loved of ssilors and

Ι of huekstersl The complexiou of youth is gone from me 3 my hair is white ς Ι rest
not day or night,and sighs give me no relief. Inow believe what 1 ones denied, that
Sabine spella are shaking my breaat, aad my head is splitting with Marsis oharms.
What aoaldst thou morel Osee and earth, I sm on dre, like Hercules with Nessus’

· blood, and Aetns’s everlasting fleme. As a eraeihle filled with Colehian drugs thou -
wilt burn till 1 shallbs eonsumed, aad my ashes seatteredto the winde. What death

· or what penalty awaits me? Speak, and Ι will offer a hundred oxea, or praise thy
ehastityin lying song. The brothers of Helen were entreated and-gave the poet haek
his eyes ς and dothan, for thou eanst, loose me thom my madnesa. Indeed thou art
aot debased by thy parents' sins; thou dost aot seatter the new huried ashes of the

“ poor; thy heart is kind, thy hands are pure, thy son iathina own, and thy births are

' no preteuee.

Why waste thy prayers upon earsthst are deaf as the roek lashed by the wavesf To
think thou shouldst publish and laugh with impunity at our mystis riter, and llll the
town with my name! What profit then have I of the skillI have learnt? Thus
shalt thou live with strength ever renewed for fresh eademnee. aa Tantalus vainly
seeks to be at rest, Prometheus ιο ιο delivered hom his vulture, and Sisyphus ιο plant

ἵ his stone on the top of his mountain. 'I'hou wilt seek death in every fonn, and it
shall not some. Ι will bestride thee, and spurn the earth in my pride. What! must
Ι, who ean move images, bring down the moon or raise the dead—I the mingler of
love·ohsrms,-must I see my spells of no avail for such as thee?
