PREFAOE. xix

a naval people ς and the Poeni were. 'Phe ‘ Bosporns' served
Horace on this occasion, and is useful again when he speaks of soar·
ing into the airin the form of a bird (C. ii. 20. 14) and visiting the
roaring Bosporus. .

When we have long been accustomed to a reading, it is very dif-
ficult to accept another, even if there is better evidence for it, and
good reasons. 'Phus in C. ii. 20. 13, Keller has ‘jam Daedaleo

notior Icaro.' Ι hardly know whether ‘ocior' or ‘ notior' is sup·
ported by the better evidence. Perhap ‘notior' is; and if vno
accept it, we escape the ‘Daedaleo ocior? Still partly from habit,
and partly for other reasons, 1 am not yet reconciled to ‘notior’

In C. iii. 4. 9, ‘altricis extra limen Apuliae,’ the question of
‘Apuliae’ is hotly debated. The word ‘ Apuliae’ following ‘Apulo'
is not the kind of repetition which seems to me to be an argument
against ‘Apuliae 3' nor is the argument derived from the quan-
tity of the first two syllables in ‘Apuliae' conclusive. Itis a
case in which critice may differ 3 but ‘Apuliae' is now generally
condemned. There is a note on this passage.

'l'he boldest attempt at alteration that I know isin 0. iii. 24. 4:
‘Tyrrhenum omne tuis et mare Apulicum,’ where Keller has ‘ter-
renum omne tuis et mere publicum‚’ and Ritter has ‘Tyrrhenum
omne tuis et mare Ponticum? Bentley hes said nothing against
the common reading. ‘Terrenum’ is Lachmann’s. Itisquiteplain
that Horace, according to his fashion, would use a proper name here,
and the MSS. have ‘Tyrrhenum' or some equivalent form. Ithinlr ·
it is equally plain that the verse would end with some other proper
name, and ‘Ponticum' is supplied by some manuscripts. Others
have ‘pulicumss ‘ publicum‚' ‘apulicum,' ‘punicum' Here isa
case of real difficulty, but it is a most perverse selection to choosc
‘ publicum‚' when we plainly require the name of a sea contrastcd
with the '‘ Tyrrhenum? If the difficulty about ‘Apulicum’ is in·
superable, we must tnlre ‘Ponticumj which being a proper name
answers one demand of the text, but does not satisfy in other
respecta, for we want the name of a sea corresponding to ‘'Pyrrhe-
num' instead of being carried off to the Euxine.

Habit aecustoms us to things which at first seem strange. ‘Mare
