HORATII FLACCI

Laeta quod pubes hedera virente

Gaudeat pulla magis etque myrto,

Aridas frendes hiemis sodali

CARMEN XXVI.

At the time this ode was written it would appear that the affairs os the Parthians were
occupying a good deal of attention at Rome, since Horace speaks of himself as the only
one who gave no head to them. The circumstances that may be supposed to be referred
to are to be gethered from the following account. In the year amo. 724, Phraates (see
Dict Biog. Arsaces xV.) being on the Parthian throne, und having hy his cruelties made
himself obnoxious to his subjecta, Tiridates, likewise one ot* the family of Arsacidae, was
set up as a rival to Phraates, but was defeated in his attempt to dethrone him, and ded
forprotectieu that same year to Augustus, who was then in Syria, aster the death ot
M. Antonius. (Dion Cass. li. 18.) Shortly atterwards, however, the Parthians succeoded
in getting rid of their king, aud Tiridates was called to the throne. ln aum. 729,
Phraates, having obtained assistance from the Scythiam, returned und recovered his
kingdom 5 und Tiridates fied to Augustus once more for protectior. He was than in Spain.
The following isJustin's account (though professing to give a particular history of Par·
thien affaire, hc does not refer to Tiridates’ former ill succeas): Phraates, he says, elated
with his success against M. Antonius, grew more cruel than ever, and in consequence
“in exilium a populo suo pellitur. ltaque cum magno ternpore finitimas civitates, ad
postremum Scythas precibus fatigasset, Scytharum maximo anxilio in regnum restituitur.
Hoc absente regem Parthi Tiridatem quendam constituerant; qui audito adventu
Scytharum cum magua amicorum manu ad Caesarem in Hispaniam bellum tunc tam·
poris gerentem profugit obsidem Caesari minimum lilium Phraatis ferens quam negli-
gentius custoditum rapuerat. Quo cognito Phraates legatos statimad Caesarem mittit,
servum suum Tiridatem et filium remitti sibi postulat. Caesaret legatione Phraatis
auditu et Tiridatis postulatis cognitis-neque Tiridatem dediturum se Parthis dixit
neque adversus Parthos Tiridati auxilia daturum. Ne tamen per omnia nihil a caeam
obtentum videretur Phraati filium siue pretio remisit, et Tiridati quoad manere apud
