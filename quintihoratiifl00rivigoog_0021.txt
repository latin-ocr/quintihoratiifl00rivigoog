MS. for ‘vetat' but if thiais so, tho preponderanoe of the evidence
for ‘vetet’ ought not absolutely to decide in this passage. 'lbere
are two objections to ‘vetatz' one is the form ‘Teque' by which
this lineis connected with the preceding, which contains ‘vivas5'
and the other is the difficulty of being certain about the meaning of
‘laevus' which, as some critica suppose, significa ‘infaustus’ a
meaning which is consistent either with ‘vetet’ or ‘vetat’ If
‘ laevus’ signifies ‘suspicione’ theu we have with ‘vetat' this
meaning, ‘And thee neither the suspicions woodpecher nor the
wandering crow forbids to go,' which is plainly not sense. I am not
sure about the meaning of ‘ vaga,’ but I think it has aninauspieious
meaning. 'Phe passage is carious, audit might be discussed before
a jury of competent men under the guidmoe of a judge, who would
prevent the advocates from quarrelling and abusing one another, as
critias do sometimes. Ι

Mr. Macleane observes that he has not accepteda single con·
jeeture made by Bentley. These conjectures, it is said, amount to
several hundreda. As far as Iknow, very few of Bentley's oon-
jeetures are now accepted by any editor3 and this is a strong eon-
demnation of a man's judgment whose great learning is acknow-
lodged. It seems as if Bentley made many of his conjectures first,
and then tried to find out reasons for them. 'Phose who know him
only by his eritioisms on Milton and his controversia] writings,
such as the Boyle Lecture and Phileleutherus Lipsiensis, may be
curicus to learn how he has handled a Latin poet in whom propriety
of expression and good teste are conspicuous. If Bentley's Latin
notes were translated into English, men who are not scholare, but
have plain good sense, would find something of the same kind that
they might have seen before in his English writings. It is true
that the notes on Horace did not allow him quite so good an oppor-
tunity of venting his coarse wit and bad taste as his attach on the
Disoourse ou ,hee-thinking by Antony Collina, the friend of John
Locha, buthe has 'done enough in his Horace to show his great
defecta, and young men should be warned against being deluded by
a profuse display of learning, which is frequently used to support a

perverse ingenuity. Bentley’s powers of assertion were strong: his
