650 HORA'PII FLACCI·

HPISTLL' XX.

With turo composition ocuooooou so no soon (onon oon incuso myouor mon un l
collection ol Epistlcs) Horace sends it forth to telo its chsuco in ιιο world. He nd· l
dresses it ss eyoung ond wauton maideu sager ιο esonpe lrom the retirement of her l
home end to ruah into dnngcra she known nothing of. He tells berit will be tce lste tc
rcpnir her error when she discovers it; thet she will be mroesed for n idme and then J

thrown nwey, and, when her youth, aud the freshuess of her beauty arc gone, she vrill
end her deys in misersble drudgery sud obscurity. He concludes with n descriptiond

himself, his person, hia churecter, aud his age. It is assumed with much conlideuue hy ἲ
ιἰιιιιιο, that the Epistle was written on Horace’s birth-day, Bth December, mun. 734, 3

ιιο yeer aster thot referred ιο nt the end. Icsnnot discover on whet grounds he rests
that opinion, or why Horace writiug ou his sorny-nnn birth-dny should tell the world
hewse terby-tour the year before. (See note cn v. 28.) He wne more likely tc dc so

οιι auy other day than thet. [Ritterconcludes thet this Epistle wns not writtmbcforc .

’ ΔΜ. 736, because it is intended ιο accompauy the lirst bools of epistles, which he was ,

publishing, and hecnuse Epistles 1³ ond 19 were also written, ss he says, in nnc. 736.
Ηο sttempts ιο explain why Horace says thet ho wss four und forty iu the consulship
of Lollius, but his explanation is not satisfactory. It seems certniu thet there wne only
ono M. Lollius, to whom Horace hes addressed two of these epistles, nnd if the poet
wished to tell his nge, he could uot do it ina more complimentsry way to Lollius, than by
seyiug whnt his ugewns in tho consulship of Lollius. No conclusion as ιο ιιο nmo
when this epistle was written cun be derived frum thet dete, except thnt ἱι was written
