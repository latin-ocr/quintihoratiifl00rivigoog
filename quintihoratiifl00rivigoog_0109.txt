CARMEN XXXIV.

1f Horace hed any serious meaning iu this ode, as Ithink he had, it is to be supposed
he wrote itunder some impulse of conscience, which told him that he had been toocare·
less of that sovereign power which governs all things. The language, though impuhive,
appears genuine3 and whether it was through the phenomenon here mentioned or any
other cause that his mind was impressed, he seems ιο express more than merely poeticul
feeling 3 and the power schnowledged is not that conventional Fortuna of the next ode,
but the Suprema Being who declares his existence by the voice of conscience, through
sudden impressione aud startling signs, such as nuder someform or other wa may believe
