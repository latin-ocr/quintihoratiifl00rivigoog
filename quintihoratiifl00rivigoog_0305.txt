s.u.u. 723.

Wm Csoear Octavianus had determined ou the expedition against bi. Antonius end
Cleopatra which led to the battle oi Actium, suo. 72³, he summoned, as we ,leam
from Dion Cassius(50.11),ths leading senators and meu oi Equestrian rank tomeet him
st Brundusium, ior the benedt of their eounsel und (the historias says) to lseep the
liqueeffim irem mischius, and niso to show the world the harmony to which he had
brought men of all orders at Rome. Whatever the motives may have been, the ilict
maybeseeepted. Msecenas obeyed this summoue und went to Brundusium, but was
sent boch by caestu to weteh over the peuce oi the city and the affairs oi ltaly, with
what particular powers, or under what title, history does not inform ns, nor is tho
question material here. 'l'he Scholiasts (Acron and comm. (trun) state that Maecenas
had received the command of the lieet, or part of it ss tribune, from Augustus. But
there isno credit due to such statements, which are osten taken (as this may be), like
the inscriptions invented by grummorians, from incidental rumen und allusione in the
odes themselves. Iis appears to huwe accompanied the expedition to Sicily against
Sextus Pompeius nmo. 718, aud the writer oi the article ‘Maecenas' iu Smith’s
Diet. Biog. thinks that this lipode was written ou thot occasion. 'l'his opinion is quite
new, and l believe the general opinion to be correct. The language of affection iu this
Bpode is too strong ior the short sequeintance Horace had then enjoyed with Maecenas ς
also, there is evidence oi the Sabine ferm having come into Horaeo’s possession when
he wrote it (v. 81). But that this did not occur till aiter the publication oi the first
book oi Satires is certain, and it is generally referred to auu. 710. The opinion oi
the mme writer thet Horace actually aceompanied Maecenas on this expedition to
Sicily is notiood elsewhere (O. iii. 4. 28 n). It is very possible that hiaecenss may
have had the oli'er of a command in the expedition against hi. Antonius, aud thet both
he and Horsoe believed ho was going ou that servies, until on hisarrival at Brundusium
Augustus thought dt to send him back te discharge more important duties st Rome.
Horace, supposiug him to bs going on this expedition, wished tu seeompany him, but
Maecenas would not allow it (v. 1), which gave occasion ior this lipode.
