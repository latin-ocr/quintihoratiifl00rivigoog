Telephus. But it looks rsther ill thst this wellhred learned Greek, who lived οιι auch
intimate terme with Horace, is never heard oi in anyother place. 'I'he best information
about him may be gleaned from the other two odes. Telephus ia a poetieal name which
Horace uses when it suits his purpose, as here, t'or instance, when he wanted such an one

Buttmann’s opinion, and I think any sensible men who redacte οιι the subject, without
preconceptions of reality ἰιι his mind, will agree with him. At any rate s very slight
groundwork of truth would be enough for the part that Telephus bears in this ode, and
on such questions conjecture and time are thrown away. [Ritter tells us to take his
word, and believe that Telephus is the rhetorician Heliodorus, S. i. 5. 2. The resson
for Horace giving him thir name is aa wonderful as the discovery itseli. Yet llitter
says that the Telephus of C. iv. 11 is a different person] of the date we ean only say

and drinking without much spirit, till at last the dulness of the conversation turning
upon dry points of history, through the prosy pedantry of some oneof the party, Horace
ean bear it no longer, and bursts out with the contemptuous language with which the
ode begins; then calls his friends ιο drink, and sets them the exarnple. It is easy ιο

which Horace bestowed more than average paine, though there is no ode in which the
“ars celare artem'’ is mors conspicuous. Ιι is impossible to suppose it the work of a
moment, as Dillenbr.¹s very neat adaptation would require us tosuppose. He thinks
theodo is one ol the early ones, as more akin to the tir-e of youth than the sobriety of
later life, to which remark I attach no importance.
