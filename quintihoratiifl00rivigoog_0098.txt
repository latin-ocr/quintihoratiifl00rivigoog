HORATH FLACCI

clauus xrrvrrr.

A grem deal has been written about this ode, as ιο ιιο spirit and pur-port of it, the
occasion of its composition, the persone introduced, aud the parts they respectively bear.
The more literally we take the ode aud the less we search for hidden meanings, or attempt
to fix the date or the cause that led ιο ιιο treiu of thought, the more likely we are, 1
conceive, to arrivs et the true bearing of the ode. Septimius, one of Horees’s most
intimate friends, had avilln at 'Parentum (C. ii. 6), where it is likely Horace on soma
occasion, if not often, pald him avieit. It seems ιο me not improbable that he may have
scenabodycast οι shore at thet pisce where the scene appears to be laid. The sight of
this body might naturally suggest such au ode as this, in which the spirit of a ship-
wrecked man ie introduced moraliring upon death aud nskiug for burial. Hie reflectione
take the form, in the first instance, of au adduces ιο Archytas the philosopher, whose
nome was associated with Tarentum, and ho joina with him other worthies, whose wis·
dom and greatuees had not saved them from the common lot of all. There may have
been a legend that Archytas was buried on the ‘litus Matinum,' generally supposed ιο
ιο a part of the range of Mons Gargarum in Apulia. Possibly e tomb was shown there
that was said ιο ιο his. But it does not follow that the speaker was there. The name

of Archytas worrld ιο suggested by hie association with Tarentum, where 1 think (from
v. 29) the scene is laid, and the name of euch a man is naturally connected with the

reflectione of this ode, even independently of his connexion with the place. 'lbet
Archytas was shipwrecked ou a voyage down the Hadriatie (which is the general
opinion) has been ιοο hastily assumed from tbie ode. If he was really buried at the
foot of Mene Garganus, there are other ways of accounting for it. But the fact is
not proved

The odehas the appearance at first eight of a dialogue, and the great msiority of l

commentatore tnke it in thet way. Though differing from othere ae ιο ιιο division of
the dialogue, which 1 thought should take place in the middle of the fiftecnth verse, 1
was once of the same opinion myself. 1 have now changed that opinion, and believe,
with Hottinger and others, quoted by Orelli in his Ercursus, that it is no dialogue
at all, whiob view I ern the more disposed to adopt, ιοοοιοο it is supported hythe
judgment of my friend Mr. Long. These who hold this opinion arc divided in their
interpretation. Casaubon affirmed that the ode was merely the poet's meditation upon
the fate of Archytas sud οι ιιο destiuy of all great men: followed by eu appeal, on
the part of Archytas, for borial (I suppose at v. 21). Liibker and Rezel think Horaee's
ghost is speaking under the fanciful uotiou that hc himself had beeu dmwned off
Palinurus (C. iii. A. 27). G. Fabricius supposed the shade of Archytas to be speaking
throughout. Hottinger (opusc. Phil. Lips. 1817) aud Weiske (Jahn. Auuol. Phil
1880) held the view that I have adopted, except that they supposed the unfortunate
man, whose body ie lying unburied, is speaking at the tomb of Archytae on the pro·
montory of Matinum. 1 see ιο occasion for that, and think the subject of theodo is
more likely ιο heve been suggested at Tarentum theu any where else. Thewords
‘Neptuno custode Tarenti' seeum to fir ιιο οοοιο. If Archytas was buried, or sup·
poscd tc ιο buried, at Matinum, it would be natural for one who thought of the
narrow space to which his greatness was reduced to mention the spot where his bones
lay. But it does not appear why a person speaking at Matinum should talk of
Neptune particularly ae the ‘custos Tarenti.’

'ibose who consider that the whole ode consiste of a dialogue between a sailor and
Archytas divide it either atter v. 6, or v. 16, or v. ιθ. They who make the mariner
caasa ιο speak οι v. 6, ιο so chiefly, ιοοοιοο ιιο subjecte that follow that verse are snp-
poeedtobeaboveaepeakerofhisclass. But,asthst would becontradicted by Archytas’
appeal to his judgment in v. 14, ithae been proposed ιο alter ‘te’ into ‘mc' or ‘se,’
