EPISTOLARUM ΙΙ. 1. 655

the ancient bards, ιο have been inspired by the Alban Musa. But if tbe seme rule
is to be applied to the Romam as to the Greeks, whose oldest poeta no doubt are
their best, then t'arewell ιο our sauses. No doubt our painting, our music, our
wrcstling, are better than the Greeks'!

(v. 34.) But if time aets on poetry as it does on wine, what number of years are required
to give it worth? Sbnll ene who has been dead a hundred years bo counted old or
new? He is old and good. Well, take away a month er a year l'rom the hundred.
Still he may be countad old. Tben l accept this admission, and take away one by
one, like the hairs from the herse’s tail, till at last be shall fall to the ground who
estimates merit by s scale of years, and only admirer what death lias consecrated.

(v. 50.) Ennius is a saga, and bold, and another Homer, iu the eyes of our critica. He
caras nothing now for his dreams and his metempsychosis. Is not Naevius in our
hands and in our memorias? Such sanctity does age give ιο poetry. Men disputa
about the merita of these old people. Pacuvius is called learned; decius sublime;
Afrmrius' toga would fit Menander3 Plautus is rapid as Epicharmus3 Caecilius beats
all in severity; Terence in dramatis skill. These we learn; these we crowd the
theatra ιο see. These are the only poete from Livius downwards.

(r. 63.) Sometimes the vulgar judgment is right, sometimes it ia wrong. ιι ιι prefers ,
these writers ιο all others it errs; if it admits that there is a good deal that is anti·
quated, much that is harah, much that is sloreuly in thern, it is wisc, ond l agree
with it, and Jove approves. Ihave no wisb ιο see Livius and his poetry hanished (l
remembcr too wall Orbilius and his eane) 3 but that any ene should think them per·
lection is to me sur-prising. ll a single word starts up bere and thera better thau the
rest it carries oti the whole. On the other handl arn indignant that any thing should
bc found fault with, not because it is bad but because it is new, and that not iudnl·
genoe but honour should be demanded for the old. If l express a doubt about a play
of Atta’s, all the old men cry out against my impudenoc for venturing ιο tind fault
with that which Aesopus aud Roscius acted. But the real reason is that they oon·
siden nothing can be right but what satisties them, or they cannot bcurto throw away
in their age what they got by beart as boys. But he who praises the song‘s of the
Salii, which he understands no better than 1 do, does so not from love to them but
out οι envy to us. If Graece bad always hated novelty as we do, what should we
have bad that ia old? When she hagan to turn from war, aud to degenerate with her
new fortunas, she went from athletas ιο horsea, hom sculpture to pointing, from
music to tragedy, likea spoilt child. But it was ιο be expected when penca and pros·
perity came; every thing that delights is apt ιο pall.

(v. 103.) Once at Rome wc used ιο see men rising early to expound the law ιο clients, or
learning how ιο make money und to be thritty. Now it is all changed, und every
body is l‘or writlng poetry. I myself, when l declara 1 shall write nemore, lie like a
Parthian, and ,begin seribbling before sun-risa. No man undertakes to stcer a ship
who knows not how ς none administer medicinas but physiciens, or handle tools but
workmen 3 and yet, learned or anlenrned‚ we all write poetry. This little error hew-
ever has its advantages. The poet loves not money, seara not loss of property, abacta
nothis partner or hia ward, lives plainly3 and though heis of no use in war, he is o?
use at homa, if yon allow that small things may help the great. 'lhe poet forans the
lips and clrsstens the minds of tlre young ς he recorda great dceds, inruisbes grean
erarnples, consoles the poor und sick. Where would he our choirs bnt for the Musa Ρ
How should we pray te tbe gods? The hemely rusties of the olden time, atter har·
vest, used ιο gether themselves together and oller sacrifice to Tellus and Faunus und
their maius. Through thern came in the Feseinnino verse, which theu was innocent
of offense, till the liberty was turned into lieenee, and the law stepped iu ιο urrest it.
When Graece became our prisoner she enatared her captors, and brought in among
