262 HORA'PII FLACCI

Magnus Annus was generally believed in is certain Virgil refers ιο it in his fourth
Eclogue: ‘⁴ Magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo” (v. ι), “incipient magui pro-
cedere mensee''(v.12)· Cicero discusses it in his treatise de Nat. Deorum (ri. 20J=
“Quarum (i. e. of the planeta) ex disparibus motionibus maguum aunum mathematici
nominaveruut; qui tum efficitur quum solis et lunae et quinque errantium ad eandem
inter se comparationem confectis omnium spatiis est faeta conversio. Quae quam longa
sit magna quaestio eat. Esse vero certam et definitam necesse est.” The statements
of the ancients vary from 49,000 ιο nearly 26‚000 years. The last corresponds to the
period calculated for the preeeeaion of the equinoxes, with which, however, the Magnus
Anum of the Greeks and Romans had nothing to do. lt is represented ou the reverse
of a model of Hadrian in the form of a man in a loose robe, with a globe and Phoenix
in his leit hand, and hia right raised over his head. He is sumounded by aa oval ring
to distinguish him stom the ligures of Eternity, represented in a circle. Τιο iuscrip-
tion is Saeculum humum. What amount of credit is due to all the details of Jahn's
explanation, which are derived chiefly from the statements of Servius on the4th llelogue
of Virgil and from Censorinus, de Die Natali, 1 cannot say. But, without rcsorting to
such explanatione as the above, it would have been very surprising if Augustus, having
resolved to celebrate a great festival iu honour of his own successful career, had not
made Apollo the principal feature ef it, and had called upon Pluto ιο blesa his country,
iu preference to that god to whom ιο allowed himself ιο ιο lilaened and whom his
flatterers assigned tobim aa his father. Horace appears ιο have been much pleased at
being chosen as poet-laureate of the occasion (C. iv. 6, lutrod.). 'l'he ode wse sung at
ιιο mest solemn port of the festival, while the emperor was in person offering sacrifica
at the second bour of the night on the river side upon three altars, attended by the
liticen meu who presided over religioua affairs. 'lhe chorus consisted of twenty-seven
boys and twenty-seven girls of noble birth, vv'ell trained no doubt for ιιο occasion
(0. iv. 6). The effect musthsve been very beautiful, aud no wonder if the impression
on Horace's feelings (for in all probability ιο was present) was strong and lasting.
Attempts hare been mode ιο distinguish the parte assigned to the respective chorusea.
But there do not appear to me ιο ιο any conclusive or very probable date on which to
found an accurate division, in which therefore, aa might be expected, the editors do not
agree. 1 have endeavoured in the argument ιο show all the divisione of the ode by its
subjecta. ln judgiug of the character of the ode as a poetical composition, it must not
be forgotten that it was written for a pecoliar and solemn occasion aad to be set te
music, in both which points it ditl'crs from most of the otherodes of Horaee; aad,judged
with reference ιο those objecta, it may be pmnounoed superior ιο laureato odes in
general. Fer rhythm it appears ιο me the best of all the Sepphic odes.
