SATIRARUM II. 3.

Aedificas, hoc est, longos imitaris ab imo
Ad summum totus moduli bipedalis, et idem
Corpore majorem rides Turbonis in armis

' Spiritum et incessum: qui ridiculus minus illo?
An quodcunque 11111 Maecenas te quoque verum est
Tantum dissimilem et tanto certare minorem?
Absentis ranae pullis vituli pede pressis,
Unus ubi effugit, matri denarrat ut ingens
Belua cognatos eliserit. Illa rogare: .
Quantane? num tantum, sufflans se, magna diisset?
Major dimidio. Num tanto? Cum magis atque
Se magis inflaret, Non si te ruperis, inquit,
Par eris. Haec 1 11 1ο1 multum abludit imago. 111
