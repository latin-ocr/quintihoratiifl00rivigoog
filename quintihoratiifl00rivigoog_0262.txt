226 HORATII annom

but not more than was uuavoidabls in alluding ιο Augustus aa the iountaiu of thoas
virtues which appeared in Drusus. Not to have alluded to 'liberius would have been
aa uuuatural aa to have omitted a more specidc mentiones hia part in the war had he
joined it when the oda was written. Bentley’a uotiou that Drusus only attached aud
defeated the Vindelici and 'liberius tha Raeti is ridiculous. Heia led to itbyv. 18 cithia
ode and 10 οοο.οι’ 0. leand by the statement oi Velleius (ii. 95), “Uterque divisis partibus

Raetos Vindelicosque aggressi,” which merely means that they divided their forces, aud

attached the tribes in different otiantem, as Livy (xliv. 11) says ol the taking of Cas·

sandraa, ‘⁸ Divisis partibus oppugnare adorti praeterat Eumenes.” lna two tmbes and
the minor tribes connected with thom were united in one league, and the idea oi the

Vindelici being attached in or near the territorias ol the Raeti (“·Raetie sub Alpibus ''),

while the Raeti themselves looked ou and waited, aa Jani says, for 'liberius' arrival, is

absurd. Iam surpriscd that Franlra adopts this notiou cu a literal interpretation of

Horace's words.

ARGUMENT.

Like the young eagle just darting on its prcy, or the young lion fresh from ita dam, was ¹
Drusus when he met the rude Vindelici, aud made thom feel what hearta could do
trained under the eye oi Augustus. 'l'he brace give birth to tba brawa. 'l'be steer
and the horse hara the blood ol their sires, and the eagle gives not birth ιο the dove.
But education brings out the seeds ol virtue. What Rome owes to the Neroneo iet
tha Metaurus witness, and the day which saw Hasdrubal defeated and drove the
clouds aud the heroe African hum latium. Oua strength has grown and our gods
hare returned hom that day, and Hannibal was forced to cry, “ As tbe deer might
pursue the wolf, we are pursuing those we should ily. Like the ahorn oali they gaiu
strength with every blow, aa tha Hydra or the monster-s oi Thebes. sink them iu
the deep, they riae more glor-iona than ever, aud overthrow their victor in hia strength.
No more shall l saud measengers ol victory to Cartlmga ς fallen, t'allen are our hopes,
and our fortune, sor Hasdrubalis gone 1³* The band of a Claudius will prosper, lor
Jove-and sagacity deliver him ἒτοω danger.
