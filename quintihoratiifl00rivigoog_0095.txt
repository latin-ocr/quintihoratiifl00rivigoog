CARMINUM Ι. 26. 59

&manoe vellet opulentum sumptum praeberi jussit. Post haec finito Hispaniensi bello
cnm in Syriam ad oempcncndum Orientis statum venisset, metum Phraeti incussit ne
&llum Parthiae vellet inferre Itaque tota Parthia captivi ex &meiano sive Antonii
exercitu recollecti signaque cnm hie militaria Augusto remissa. Sed et tilii nepotesque
Phraatis obsides Augusto dati, plusque Caesar magnitudine nominis sui fecit quam
aruris alius imperator facere potuisset ’' (Justin, llist. xlii. ὅ). Iheve given all thia
passage, aa it contains with sufficient accuracy most of the events of Parthian history
which Horace alludee ιο. 'l'he resembling of the Scythiam force und the alurm of 'liri-
dsfee are evidently referred to here, and the twc seem to be associated. lt is natural
toinfer, therefore, that it was just before llridatee iled from his kingdom, in amo. ’
⁷29, that the ode was composed. Some, however, have referred it ιο the period when
Pbraetes¹ ambosaadore were in treaty with Augustus, eud when the faie of Tiridates
was undecided‚ which would put the date a year later. Others again hare assumed
that the whole of the transactione described by Justin are ιο be referred ιο the year
721» and that Tiridaten never fied ιο Angustus in Spain at all. This ie the jndgment
of lachmann (Lat. ιο Franks, p. 239), but it ie rather en unwarrnnteble judgment.
Justin had the history of Trogus, which he abridged‚ and must have known better
than lachmann what it contained. His reason, moreover, for wishing ιο place the date
of the ode further bach is nothing more than un objection to the rhythm of the 'fth and
llth veram, which ia a very fallacious argument. ln favour of the earlier date is
quoted, by Orelli, Virg. Georg. ii. 495 :-
“ Illum uon populi fasces non purpure regum
alexit et infidos ag'tans discordia fratres 3¹'

where the brethren ere Phraates and Tiridates. The Georgica having been written not
later than 724, it ie assumed that the eveute ebore referred to must have talen place
before that year. But the earlier ond unauccessful designa of Tiridates are more pro·

hably referred ιο by Virgil. against the earlier date there is en argument of much
weight iu the age of Lamia. Ηο died amc. 786 (Tac. Ann. vi. 27), and the year before·
he had held the office of praefect of the city. Ifho was only twenty when this ode was
written, he must have been eighty-two when he died, end eighty-oue when he held the

above post, which was made one of considerable importance by Augustus and continued

to be ao under his successor. He is described ae being ‘vivida senectute' at the cloec

of his life, eud it is just possible he may have held the above postet thet advenced nge,
hut it is not probahle, and 1 thinh ιι a falr argument, aa far es it goes, fer patting the

date of the ode aa lete ae we can. Por further particulare respecting lamia aee iii. 17.

'l'he stampe to deduce from this ode any evidence of hie being of a melancholy tempe-

rament ie ridiculosas

ARGUMENT.

Aa the friend of the Muses should, 1 toas care to the winda, aud mind not as every oue
else does the alarms of Tiridates. Sweet Muse, weave a garland for my Lamia. All
my honours without thee are nought ς him shouldst thou with thy sistere consecrate
with the lyre.
