564 HORATII rnaccl

Auriculas citharae collecta sorde dolentes.
Sincerum est nisi vas quodcunque infundis acescit.
Sperne voluptates, nocet empta dolore voluptas.
Semper avarus eget: certum voto pete finem
Invidus alterius macrescit rebus opimis ;

Invidia Siculi non invenere tyranni

Majus tormentum. Qui non moderabitur irae
Infectam volet esse dolor quod suaserit et mens,
Dum poenas odio per vim festinat inulte.

Ira furor brevis est: animum rege, qui nisi paret
Imperat; huno frenis, hunc tu compesce catena.
Fingit equum tenera docilem cervice magister
Ire viam qua monstret eques 3 venaticus, ex quo

Tempore cervinam pellem latravit in aula,
Militat in silvis catulus. Nunc adhibe puro
Pectore verba, puer, nunc te melioribus offer.
