Netwithstuudiug Agripps’s close eonnexion with Augustus, lt is very pmbahle that
between that stern man end Horace there wus but little sympstlry er intercourse, aud
without personal affection his muse did not riae 1ο ita highest flights in the way olper-
sonal enlogy. nnc during the time that he was writing the odes which compone the
three first books, judging by their character we may believe that he reelly felt unequsl
or indisposed for siugiug the praises ola military hero, sud thnt he considered such sub·
jecta unsuited to him. Twics hs eheclss himsell' when be geta upon heroic themes (C.
ii. 1. ³73 iii. 0. 69), but not till he has shown how competent be was, had he pleused, to
hare bundled them, as he shewed when hs rssumed this style ο1 composition in later
years, sud wrote thet noble ode in prsise of Drusus (ru. 4).
