Duentzer calis this Satine “felicissima totio? Dacier thinks nothing could be more
ingenious “que le tour qu’il donneb cette Setire, ni plus heurenx que le choix des
scteure qn’il iutrodnit.'' The extravaganoe of the anachronism end the incongruity
of the persons heighten the absurdity, but do not help the Setire, es far ss 1 cen see.
Homer (Odyse xi.) makes Ulysses go down to' Hedes aud there meet Tiresias the
'l'hebnn prophet, who tells him of the herdships that awsited him in his journey home,
where however in the end he is destined to arrivs. Horeee supposes acontinuetion of
the internisve, and mslses Ulyssee sels the soothsayer how heis to repuir his fortunes
when he gete home, and finds bis property wested by hie wife's enitere, ne the prophet
told him it would be (sea note on v. 6). Tiresias, though be implies that the osmning
Ulysses wouldbe at no loss in snobe matter ifhe once got home, mles him his advice,
which isto lny himself out for plessing old men aud women of fortune, end getting
nnmcd in their wille, for which be luye down a few ordinsry rules, of which n pereo·
veriug end coerse servility is the chief, such as Periplectomenes describes in the Miles
Gloriosus, iii. 1. 110 sqq. Ulysees appears in as lowa cherecter es he cem-sn spt
disciple, ready to be the ebndow ofa elewe, end to prostitutehis cbaste Penelope if used
be. The Ulysses of all poete efter Homer ie e contemptible personage, end it must be
snid iu favour of Hornoe that Penelope, whose cherecter iu the Odyssey is feminine end
pure, is by inter writers represented as loss cheste than Homer bas drswn her. · 'ibose
who only know her ee the virtnous wife end mother, will not eseily forgive the coerse
allusione to her in thie Satine. Senedmr end Dacier are euxinus it should bennderetood,
that when Ulysses eppears to acquiesco in the advice of the prophet, he has no intention
of demenning himself so far ns to follow its “il se retire apres le consultation sens
repondre senene et sarrs dtclnrer le pnrtit quoi il ee determine” (Sensdon). As it
would he difficult to evoid condemning ¹the whole construction of the satire except by
understending ittobe sn extravagant burlesque, wo need not be at the trouble of deter-
miuing wbst the intentione of Ulysses were when the imperious Proserpine ebruptly
summoned bis counselior, and brohe off tbe dialogus.

lte mention of the Parthians (r. 62) once mone reises up among the chronologiets
the ghost of Cresius and the sundsrds recovered in s.11.0.734. 'fbe Prench editors
mle it for granted the Satire wes written efter thet event. Pranhe more pnobsbly

’ places the dete before the battle of Actium, though he should have remembered C. i.

2. 41,

⁴⁸ Sive mnuta juvenem ligura
Ales in terris imiteris,'’

where, by ‘juvenem' Augustus is clssrly meent (see note), before he mmo to the con-
clusion that nster the battle of Actium ‘¹ pects unicum rerum srbitrnm vix juvenis
nomine insignirisset.” The above ode was written not earlier then hnc. 725.
