GARMEN XXIX.

ln the yesr of tho city 730 sn army wss sent into Arabis Felix by Augustus under
Aelius Gallus, who wss governor of Egypt. The l'orce chiefly consisted οι troops stc-
tioned in that province (Strabo, p. 819: Γάλλος Αἴλιος μέρει τῆς &Alpino φρουρᾶς εἰς
τὴν Ἀραβίαν tutante: und p. 780); but the prospect of weulththe expedition held out,
from tho indefinite knowledge then possessed of the country, nttrncted young men et
Romesud induced‚ it would seem, Iccius,c mun of studione habits, ιο join it. The ex·
pedition wcs nttended with disaster, und the greater part of the force perishcd. Iccius
survivcd, und we ilud Horace writing to him s few years luter ss Agrippe’s stewnrd iu
Sicily (lippi. 12). Beyond this nothing is known of Iccius. Mnch has been said
sbcnt his being svsncious, und thst is the opinion ottho nnthor of his lile in the
Biogrsphicnl Dictioucry usually referred to in these notes, who says that both in
this ode sud the epistle ‘¹ Horace reprehends pointedly but delicately iu Iccius an inor·
dinste desire lor weslth.” 1 do not think this ides would have presented itself to sc
many minds if the Scholiasta had not mede such remarks *ss these: “Ad Iccium
scribit quem miratur philosophice intermisso studio repente se ad militarem vitem
contulisse cupiditate divitiarum.”·-“ Parsimonium laudet cum mordacitate '’ (Acron).
“Per quod videtur concupiscere divitius Arabum.''—“ Inconstantiae reprehendit qui
per avaritiam philosophice studium militis mutavit” (Porphyrion). Such remarks
prove nothing sud throw no light upon Horacc’s meaning. 'l'hc point is not worth
discussing es respecto the unknown Iccius; but the character oi the ode is lustin this
view of it. It is s piece of good-tempered joculnr irony, of which the point lies in
the man of books going forth ss c conqueror to subduc liercc ustione untumed before,
end to return lnden with the spoils oi the Esst. Iccius muy have been of a restless
chursoter end not essily satisfied with his position, if we may judgs of the longusgc of
the epistlc; but that scarcely aueeu the spirit of this ode, in which there does not
cppecr ιο bc sny thing serious expressed or intended. Inter times have scen young
und chirslrcus men husteuing to un El Doredo in expectation ofiwenlth und dis·
tinction, und findIng nothing but disappointment, end such sppecrs to heve been the
caseon tho occasion of this expedition into Arabia.

Jacobs has discussed these two poems in his Lect. Venusinus, Art. ἰ.. rcprinted from
the Rhein. Mus. 1828. As the expedition wne sometime prepuring, itisnotclesrwhether
this ode was written nuc. l30, the year of the expedition, or s year or two earlier.
