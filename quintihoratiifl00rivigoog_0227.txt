As well rob thalienses oi'her whelps, Pyrrhm Τιοι girl will rush ιο the rescae cf her
lower, and like a coward and thiel thou shalt quit the field aiter a hard-fought battle
in which he shall stand like Nireus or Ganymede, the umpire ol the light.

Now vides quanto moveas periclo,

Pyrrhe, Gaetulae catulos leaenae?
Dura post paullo fugies inaudax
Proelia raptor
Cum per obstantes juvenum catervas ο
Ibit insignem repetens Nearchum,
Grande certamen tibi praeda cedat
Major an illi.
Interim, dum tu celeres sagittas Ι
Promis, heco dentes acuit timendos, ιο
Arbiter pugnae posuisse nudo
Sub pede palmam
Fertur, et leni recreare vento
Sparsum odoratis humerum capillis,

Qualis aut Nireus fuit aut aquosa 15
Raptus ab Ida.
