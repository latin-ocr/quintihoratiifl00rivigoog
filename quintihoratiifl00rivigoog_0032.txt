in his hands, and have passed into a smooth monotony‚ which none
bnt an emasculatcd teste can admire when compared with the Greek
originale. Some may doubt whether tho defect does not lie in the
languaga, and perhaps in some degree it does3 but the later Sapphic
Odee are more like the Greek in point of rhythm, and are so far an
improvement upon the earlier ones. Some of the more difficolt long
matres have been as successfully imitated as the language allowed, but
many have not been attempted.

. Horace's religione opinions have been a good deal discussed. Bothe
does not appear at any time to have been very decided iu his opinions.
He was npwards of forty when hc declared of himself that he was like
a ship driven by a tempest, going this way or that, according as the wind
happened to set. He was now a rigid moralist, now a materialist, now
a Stoic, now an Epicurean, now a Cyrenaic. To judge him by his own
writings, he seems to have thought that the enjoymcnt of the present
hour was the end of man's life. He nowhere puts forward me happi-
ness of another world as the compensation for the inequalities of this,
nor does he make any allusion to another state of existence at all,
except in the ordinary sabulone way. The certainty of death and the
uncertainty of life are only arguments with him for making the most of
the plcasures we possess, but all in the way of moderatior, which isa
common-place much dwclt upon by Horace, as also ie the possession and
use of riches. Once, if we arc totakehim athis word, hc was startled by
a stom, and induced from an idler to become serious3 theotisto put
away the doctrines of Epicurus, for what length of time we do not know.
But of systema he appears tc have known little. He ridiculas them all
in tlreir turn.

After Maecenas had given him his farm, he lived there a good deal
and improved it st much expense. He had a liking for the country,
and has some beautiful descriptione of it. But when in the country he
no doubt felt lonely, and missed the tables and society of his city friends.
lle dined a good deal with rich people, but his own fare ot home was of
the simplest kind. He describes his daily life in the city, when he
happened to be discngaged, in the sixth Satira of the first book. His
health was indifferent, as before observed. His eyes in particular
troubled him. He speaks of himself as grey before his time. Suetonius
says he was short and fat, and he describes himself good humouredly
as a lit snmple of a hog from Epicurus'styOEpp. i.4. 16). Augustus
rallies him on his stature, in a letter cf which part is given in Suetoniue'
life of Horace.

The lifc of Horace rvas written by Porphyrion, the Scholiast frc-
quently referred to in these noles. He mentions that memoir himself:
