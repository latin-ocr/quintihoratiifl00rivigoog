ιιι HORATII FLAOCI

out ior some one less knowing or less bold, and part with them if necessary at ι
sacrifice. There cun be little doubt that the Damasippus here mentioned is the ιιιιοι
Horace introduces in this Satire. Doering und other commentatore, following (lom.
Cruq. (who says ‘¹ consumpto per mercatum patrimoni0''), call hira a ‘ mercator,' which
it is plain hs was not. 'l'hat he was not a regular traderis clear from the people calling
him ‘Mercurialem’ (v. 25). Τιι ‘mercatores' were always under the protectior of
Meroury (“ Mercuriales viri ''), ιιι there would be nothing particular in the applica·
tion of the word ιο Damasippus if he had not been merely a private person, who had
turned his hand ιο trading. Why Horace should have chonen this man as the mouth-
ptoee of his Satira does not appear. He says himself, it is true, that having ruiued his
own affairs he had nothing to do bnt to attend ιο the affairs of others, ,which Horace
interprets ιο mean, that he had taken ιο giving advice when it was not aslred (see
v. 27 n.). But Horace may have had better ressone for employing this nran's name,
which wc have ιο means of knowing. He may have rained himself and tehen ιο οιιι,
ιι Horace here represents; but we know nothing further about him.

Stertinius appears to have besu an authority among the Stoica of the day. 'l'hs
Scholiasta tell ιι ιι wrote 220 ιοοιι οι ιιι doctrines of that school. Damasippus
calls him (v. 286) “ sapientum octavus.’' His boolrs, if be ever wrote them, hasa not
reseued him from oblivion. Horace mentions him again in Ilpp. i. 12. 20 ιι ιιι repre·
sentative of the sect. Estrd suggests that he may have been the Stertinius mentioned
by Quintilian (iii. 1, 21) ιι ιιι author of ι bestiae on oratory, though, as he says, the
Stoica troubled themselves less with rhetoric than with dialectis.

'l'he discoume of Stertinius turns upon this dogma, that every mau in ιιι world, high
or low, ismad except the saga (see note on av. 46). Cicero ιιι argued the same doctrine
of ιιι Stoice inhia Paradoxa (iv. tva reis ἄφρων μαίνεται), ιιι ιι does not go very
desp into the subject, or throw much light upon it.

ARGUMENT.

You write so seldom, und destroy what you have written, and are augry with yonrseli

¹ because you are too isay to write any thing worth speaking of. What do ιοι mean
to do? You acknowledge you came to this retreat to escape the noise of the Satur·
nalia. Well, then, begin: let us have something suited to your intentione. Ιιί of
no use to find fault with your pens ιιι best the wall Where are all your promises?
What have you brought out all your books fori Do you mean to avoid odium hy
shirking your duty? Men will only despice you for your psins. ”lis nothing hut
sloth. l'lee from the Siren, orbe content ιο forfeit all you have earued in better days.

(v. 16.) Ηιιιιι reward you, Damasippus, with a barbarior your good advice. But
how came you to know me so well?

Since the asurers robbed me of ull my money, Ihave taken ιο managing other pcople's
affairs. 1 used ιο ιο ιιοι ι successful driver οι bar-gains in all sorta of property,
that people called me every where the ward of liencury.

1 am sware of that How did you get rid of that mania i Yon seem, however, only
ιο have exchangsd it for another, as a pain in the head is musfarred to the stomseh,
or as the patient in a stupor suddenly falls to fighting his doctor. Only ιοιί follow
his example, ιιι yon may have it all your own way.

(v. sl.) My good friend, you need not deceive yourself. You, and all fools 1 may say,
aro mad, if there be any trath in Stertinius, who saw me one day ss 1 was ready to
throw myself into the river ς and “for shame,” said he: “why should you mind
being called mad when all ars soi For what is madnessi Polly and blind ίςιοτιιιι
of the truth All are mad from ιιι highest te the lowest, except the wisc. ιι in ι
wide wood where all lose their way, though all go in different directions so is it with
fools. One is afraid where there is no imur another wantouly rushes into danger,
