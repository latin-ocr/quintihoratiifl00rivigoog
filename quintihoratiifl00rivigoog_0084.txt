GARMEN XIX.

Glycera (Γλυκέρα) is one os Horace's favour-ite names. She is set down as the Cinara
ofc.iv.1s.21 (sec m), but with what show oi reason, beyond their having the same
number ot syllables, itis not easy ιο see. We need not talre Horace too much at hia
word when he says that his days of love were over. Many a young sentimentalist has
imagined thia and found himself mistalren as the poet appears to have done. These
who ehoose to insist that Horace is ooniessing ou his own account that “the heyday of
his blood was tamed‚'’ put this ods rather late, auc. recor 730. Others lind in the
abadon to the Parthian (v. 12) occasion ιο tir the date a few years later (784 or 735),
when the standards of &mars had been recovered from that troublesome enemy. 'Ibis
important epoch isever before the minda of one section of the chronologists: “dics
noctesque quidam veluti spectris territi cogitassent de signis ct captivis a 734 a Parthis
Augusto redditis,'' says Franks, whose acumen, however, while it has led him ou the
whole into a mors consistent aud probabis chronological schema than Kirchner and
others, is not above being misled by too much zeal for its own inventione I should be
no more disposed with him ιο say Horace wrote this ode while the Arabiau expedition
(i. 29) was pending, than with hia adversaries that be wrote it five or six years later.
When or under what circumstances or to whom (if any body) hc wrote, we must be

' content ιο be ignorant. (See O. iv. 1, Introduction.)

face so dangerous to loolr upon. With all her strength hath Venus come upon me,
and bids me sing no more of idle themes, the Scythian aud the Parthian. Build me
an altar, slaves, bring boughs and incense and wine, for I would solten the goddess
with c vistim.
