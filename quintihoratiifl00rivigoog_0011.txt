possunt³.” Nor do I think he is muoh more happy, in most in-
stanees (especially in the Odes), in his ohoiee of readings 1111111 in
his conjectures. He was always liable to be misled by want of ear
and poetieal teste, as well as by the exosas of a prurient segaoity⁴

and an unbounded egotism. 'l'he text in this edition will be found to
differ less from Orelli’s than from any other. Where it does so the
reason is, I think, always given in the notes. He oollated some
exeellent MSS, especially three in the library at Berne, of whioh
the oldest he plaees at the end of the eighth eentury or the be·
ginning of the ninth, and the other two in the tenth. His other
MSS. were one of St. Gallen nearly¹ oomplete, and another of
Ziirieh containing the Odes, Epodes, and Ars Poetioa, both of
which he says are of the tenth oentury. Other MSS. referred to
in these notes are the Vatioan and other Roman MSS. oollated by
Fea (1811) ; twenty-three MSS. in the Royal Library at Paris
oollated by Pottier (1823) , varying in age from the tenth to the
thirteenth eantur-53 and sundry others quoted with or without
name by Inmbinus (loir), Cruquius (1611 ¹), Torrentius (16081,
aad Bentley (1711). Of 11101111 the most important are four
eollated by Cruquius, and known as the Blandinian MSS. belonging
to the monks of a Benedictine monastery in Flanders, aud whieh
were very soon afterwards destroyed with the monastery by fine.
'Phe oldest of these, whioh is appealed 10 as a great authority, but
whioh was certainly more often wrong than right in the metenses
in whioh Cruquius quotes it, was said to tbe earlier than the ninth
eentury. On the margin of this MS. Cruquius found 101110 old
notes, which, as he says, with infinite paine he deeiphered, and he
has added them to his own commentary in aseparate form. These
seholia are referred to under the abbreviated title of comm. Oruq.
