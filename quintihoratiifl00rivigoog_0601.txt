EPISTLE III.

auc. 734.

ln auo. 734 sn ambwy came from Armenia ιο Roma, expressing tha dissutisfaction
oi tha people with their king Artaxias, and praying that Augustus would place upon
the throne that king’s younger brother Tigranes, who was then living at. Rome.
Augustus asseuted, and sent his stepson 'liberius claudius Naro with digranes to de·
throne Artaxias (Dion. tic. 7, 9.) 'liberius did this, and with his own hand crowned
'ligranea (Suetonius, Tib. c. 9.) This summary proceeding was made tha most οἲ at
Rome, though there appears to have been little resistanoa. There was a madal struck
on tha occasion, with the inscription “, Armenia capta’' Horace speaks (Ep. 12. 26) ot’
the Armenian having fallen by tha valour oi 'liberius 3 and Velleius says Armonio was
reduced to tha power of the Romans. lt had been so virtually since the submissiou
oi 'tigranes' grandfather ιο Gn. Pompeius. [Velleius (ri. 94) says that 'liberius phaed
Artavasdes on the throne. See the notes iu Burmann'e ed]

'libarius appears to have had a number cf young men with him, such aa Titius,
Celsus, and Munatius, mentioued in this Epistle, aud Julius morus, to whom it is
addressad. What little cau ba said about the first three will be found in tha notas.
Ol Florus Porphyrion says, “Fuit satirarum scriptor cujus sunt electae ex Ennio.
Lucilio, Varrone.'’ From thia Epistle (v. 23) we infer that hc was practising ιο ιο·
· coma an orator or a jurisconsultus, and that he wrote verses οι ιιο soster sort 3 and in
tha second Epiatle ot the second book (v. 59) we have the same information.

‘⁴ Carmine tu gaudes, hic delectatur iambis ;
lile Bioneis sermonibus et sala nigro.''

He may have written Satires, but it would seem hom the last quotation that he had
not written any when ‘Horace sent him that Ilpistla ,lt tha Scholiaat ia ιο ιο trusted
(aud it is not likely hc invented what ha says), Florus publiaheda selection from the

· old writers mentionedbyPorphysicn. Quintilian (lust. Orat. x. 3) tells an anecdota

of one J ulios Florus, who was uncle to an intimate iliend oi his, J alius Secundus, aud
whom he calls ‘⁶ in eloquentia Galliarum (quoniam ibi demum exercuit eam) princeps.”
'l'hia may be the person Horace addreases, and it* ao he carried out successtully ιιο pur·
suit of which Horace here supposes him to be beginning the practica. He is also sup·
posad by Weichert to be tha person mentioned by Tacitus (Anu. iii. 40, 42) as the
lcader oi' an insurrection oi the 'lheviri which is very improbable. How he got the
gentile mma Julius is uncertain. 'l'he cognomen Florus belonged to tbe Aquillia gensy
and there was u L. Aquillius Florus, one of tha ‘triumviri monetalcs' at this time,
several of whose coins are extant. Some ot them are given in the Dict. Biog. lt is
supposed he received tha ‘civitas' from G. Julius Caesar and toolr his name. But wa
know nothing about this. Horace had a great segurd for him, aa appears not only
