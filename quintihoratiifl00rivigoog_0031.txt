ΙΝΤΒΟΙΠΙΟἸῚΟΝ.μ xxvii

Canidia some real intrigueand jealousy no doubt are connected, whatever
her name may hare been.

The same remark applies in some measure to other Odcs addressed
nominally to friends, but which might as easily be addressed to ona
friend as to another. The difference is that the names are in most
instanoes known to be those of real persons, which has led many com·
mentators into inferences respecting the characters and circumstances
of those persons which I believe to be in most instaures imagiuary.

Ihave expressed my opinion of Horace asa Satirical writer iu various
places. 0n this point the reader may refer to the remarks in the
Introduction to the ninth Satira of the first book. · Of common sense
and a perception of the ridiculous3 of that knowledge of mankind which
is gothered by mixing with tho world ; of dramatic skill; of good
nature and good breeding‚ Horace has shown sufficient procis, both in
the Satires and the Epistles. As a critic he is certainly defective.
Homer he does not appear to have understood. Plautus and Terence
he could not appreciata, and the merita of Lucilius (and he must have
had merite) would probably never have been acknowledged or discovered
by Horace but for the feeling his criticism of that writer raised againm
himself. He was of an indolent habit, of which the unfinished state of
some of his poomsis one of the effecta. “Amphora coepit institui3
currente rota cur urceus exit ?” is a question that might be applied, I
think, to more than one of his Satires and Epistles. There is more
inequality in these thau in the Odes3 more also thatis common-place in
thought and diction. The Odcs will bear better than the Satires and
Epistlas the closeinspection that au editor is obliged tc give thern. Any
one who undertakes that office for Horace will find that one of his prin-
cipal difficulties consiste in the examinatior, first separately, and then
collectively, of so many smallpictures astho Odes present. The tendency ,
of commentatore to iar-fatched conjectures as to 'their scope, allusione,

date, dcc, is very great, and the above difficulty partly accounts ior it. ,

Their beauties and merita appear to me to be os a quiet kind, and
the happy selecticn of words isone of them. Horace’s selection of
epitheta is judicious and forcible. “Mirus ac paene divinus Horatius
est in epithetis inveniendis ⁶.’' The terseness and good sense of the
sayings which concern human life aud character are as striking aa
the manner in which they are introduced, being always in their placa
and never brought in clumsily, as such sentences with less art might
easily appear. Herein, more than in any other respect, Horace suc·

cseded in hia attempt to imitate the Greek Lyric pects. Their firc,
passion, sublimity, hia language was incapableof expressing, eren is his
mind could have conceived them. Their matres have lost their strength
