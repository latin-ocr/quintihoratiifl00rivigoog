xxx . INTRODUOTION.

Ο. 1. 3.—This is another cf the Asclepiadem metros, consisting ο1
two verses alternating thus:

-ΞΙ-υυΙ-υῦ

..-Ι-υοΙ-ΙΙ-υυΙ-υε

Ι The first cf these verses is called after Glycon, a poet whose age and
birthplace are unknown. Τ11ο second verse is the same as C. i. l. Το
this metre also belong O. i. 13.19. 363 iii. 9. 115. 19. 24, 25. 28;
iv. 1. 3.

Ο. 1. 4.-This melre hae its name from Archilochus of Paros. It
consiste of alternate verses, of which the first is one of those that the
grammarians call ἀωονάρηφτοΰ, because they consist of different mea· ·
sures which do not blend together. The first four feet are those of an
hexameter verse, alter which follow three trochees, the first part being
always distinct from the second. The second is a catalectic iambic
trimeter, that is, it has one syllable wanting in the last feet. There is
no other Ode in this metro.

Ο. i. 5.-This is also rechoned with the Asclepiadean matres, though
only the two first lines have their name from Asclepiades, being the
same as Ο. 1. The third is called after Pherecrates, the comic poet of
Athens. It consiste of a dactyl between two spondeas, if' my ear does ’
· not deceive me; but it is usual to mark it with a spondae, choriambus,
andlong syllable. The fourth is the Glyconean verse, which occurs in
O. 3. Το this matre belong O. i. 14, 21, 233 iii. 7, 13; iv. 13.

and perhaps in the line of Heracer
‘Quindecim Diana preces virorum.¹

11 Horace hac generally avoided this form ο1 the verse, the dialilre seems to hare been
diminished aa hia aar improved; ec that while therela but one instance ο1 such a
caesura in the second book of the Carmina, and not one in the third, there are no lesa
thantwentytwo in the fourth, and inthe Carm. Sacc. one on an armagein every manaa
Nay, even in cuch linea aa ‘Doctus ct Phoebi chorus et Dianae’ we preter tha double
trocheo secent at the commeneement tc that which Dr. Caray considers cc swect, who
virtually makes ‘chorus' a trochce, and would, we suppose,give the sound of a dactyl to
Romulm in ‘Romulae genti date remque prolem Ι que nt decus omne? 11 any one will
read over tha O. S. with the necent we contcnd for, he will readily perceive the bcauty
citha metra, and ccase to wonder that Sappho and Catullus hesitated not tc mnis the
fourth syllable short. ln particular much beanty will be added to the line ‘dam sida
et Pax et Honos Pudorque! According to Dr. Carey'a action ο1 a metrical recent,
‘Pax' will lose all emphasis”

8πρῶτος &cambron Ἀρχίλοχος κέχρηται (Hephaestion, p. 48, ap. Bentley on
lipod. ii). ‘l'he Scholiast on Hephaestion, p. 52, says thera were no less than sixty-ioar
matres ο1 this sort used by the Greeks.
