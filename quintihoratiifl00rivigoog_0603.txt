EPISTULARUM l. 3.

Quis sibi res gestas Augusti scribere sumit?
Ι Βο110 quis et paces longum diffundit iu aevum?
Quid Titius Romana brevi venturas in ora?
Pindarici fontis qui non expalluit haustus,

Thebanos aptare modos studet auspice Musa,
An tragica desaevit et ampullatur iu arte?
Quid mihi Celsus agit? monitus multumque monendus 15
