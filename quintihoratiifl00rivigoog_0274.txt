238 HORA'I'II FLACCI

OARMEN VIII.

All that is known ol O. Marcius Censorinus, the person ιο whom this ode is ad·
dressed, may be found in Smith's Diot. Biog. (Censorinus, 6). Hs was a man of birth
and education, and mach beloved, according ιο Velleius (ri. 102), who says oi hia
daath, “Graviter tulit civitas.'’ Horace pays him the complimsnt oi believing that
he would asteem an ode of his more highly than any costly gista ho could offer in
acoordanos with tho common practice among friends of making each other present·

Donarem tripodas, praemia fortium

Gaudes carminibus; carmina possumus

Donaro et pretium dicare muneri.
