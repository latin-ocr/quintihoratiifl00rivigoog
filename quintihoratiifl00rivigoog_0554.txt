518 HORATII FLACCI

‘Instituunt sic dis placitum, tu carminis esto
Principium. Romae sponsorem meropis Eja,
Ne prior officio quisquam respondeat, urge.

Sive Aquilo radit terras seu bruma nivalem

interiore diem gyro trahit, ire necesse est.

Postmodo, quod mi obsit clare certumque locuto,

Luctandum in turba et facienda injuria tardis.

‘¹ Quid vis, insane, et quas res agis ?” improbus urget

Iratis precibus3 “ tu pulses omne quod obstat, 30
Ad Maecenatem memori si mente recurras ?”

Hoc juvat et melli est ; uon mentiar. At simul atras
Ventum est Esquilias, aliena negotia centum

Per caput et circa saliunt latus. “Ante secundam
