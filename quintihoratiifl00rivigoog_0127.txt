CARMINUM II. 3.

Nec sitim pellit nisi causa morbi

Fugerit venis et aquosus albo
Corpore languor.

Redditum Cyri solio Phraaten

Dissidens plebi numero beatorum

Eximit Virtus populumque falsis
Dedocet uti

Vocibus, regnum et diadema tutum

Deferens uni propriamque laurum

Quisquis ingentes oculo inretorto
Spectat acervos.

OARMEN III.

The parson to whom this ode ia nominally addreeserl is supposed generally to be
Q. Dellius, who, from being a follower first of Dolabella and theu of Brutus and Caesius,
became a devoted adherent of M. Antonius, and his tool throughout hie intriguee with
Cleopatra, till shortly before the battle of Actium, when he quarrelled with Cleopatra
and joined Octavianus, who received him with favour (Plut. Anton. c. 59). Plutarch
calls him irrepente. Comm. Cruq. gives the name ‘bellua’ aad Horace bad a friend
L. Gellius Poplicola, brother of Messalla, whom he alludes to in Sat. i. 10. 85, and who
was taken prisoner by Brutus and Cassius. (Sea iletre, p. 174.) thtber vve take
Dellius or Gellius it matters little. Horace's way of giving a nemeto hia odes hasbeen
sufficiently notieed, and iu this, as in other cases, there is nothing to gulde us to the
person whose name he uses. 'ibe oda is on two ofbis usual common-places, moderatiora ·
and the certainty ofdeath. 1 mnnot gowith Franks in assiguingthe ode to auo. 725
