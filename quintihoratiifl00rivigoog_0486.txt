HORATII FLAOGI

Lassus ab indomito, vel si Romane fatigat

Militia assuetum graecari, seu pila velox

Molliter austerum studio fallente laborem,

Seu te discus egit, pete cedentem adra disco;

Cum labor extuderit fastidia, siccus, inanis

Sperne cibum vilem 3 nisi Hymettia mella Falerno 15
Ne hiberis diluta. Foris est promus et atrum

Defendens pisces hiemat mere: cum sale penis
