290 HORATII FLAOCI.

Quin ubi perire jussus exspiravero,
Nocturnus occurram Furor

Petamque vultus umbra curvis unguibus,
Quae vis deorum est manium,

Et inquietis assidens praecordiis

Pavore somnos auferam.
³ Vos turba vicatim hinc et hino saxis petens
Contundet obscoenas anus,
Post insepulta membra different lupi
Et Esquilinae alites; 100
Neque hoc parentes heu mihi superstites
Effugerit spectaculum.

CARMEN VI.

'ihc Scholinst Porphyrion says oi this oda that it is directed against some man who
was ςίιοιι ιο attacking virulently unoliending persons. Acron says his name was Cassius,
aad that he wasa slanderons poet. Componndiug these statements, and ampliiyingthem
hcm his own head and the langnage oi the ode, Crnquius' Scholinst makes Cassius ιο
be Cassius Sevems, an orator oi grem celebrity and bitterness, who was banimcd by
Augmtus, and aiter remaining in axilsior twenty-live years dieda beggsrsen. 88, more
than sixtythrae years aster the composition oi this oda. 'Ihc Scholiast'a authority is
destroyed by his own descriptiones Severus, who, hc says, was very abusive snd attached
tha best of men, bnt was easily appeased by tllling his belly and plying him with money,
lor which reason Horace compares him to a dog, ιο. 'lhis is the language oi a mere
compiler, and is worthy of no eredit. 'lhe silence of Porphyrion, and the positive state·
ment ci Acron that the Cassius cithia ode was a poet (which we have no authority for
supposing Severm was), as wellas the extreme youth oi Severus at the time it was
written, are all opposed to the notion that he is the person attached3 and morsorer so
fur from being the osward Horace describes, Senem boldly attached men oi influente,
and suffered ior doing so ς and as to his avarica, it was through persisting in the course
his nature inehned him to,ofindisori1ninats abnse, that ha carne to destitution and died
in that condition. Although therefore Comm. Oruq. has been followedby all tbe editors
