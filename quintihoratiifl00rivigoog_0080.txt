HORATII FLACCI

CARMEN XVII.

it may cntemain the render to know that a treatise was once written on the subject
of Horace’s Tyndaris, in which it was proved to the satisfaction oi tho writer that she
was a freedwoman of Rhacmetalces, king of Thrace; that she is the per-mu Horace else·
where speslrs oi as Thressa Chloe, simply chios, and Venus Matina ς also that she was

ι a poetess. lt being mamad that the last ode was addressed to Tyndaris, according to

the common inscriptions, it is supposed by many that the lovers had made up their

quarrel, end that Horace here proposes a meeting ιο scal their reconciliation. All this
which is plainly unreasonabie should be put asida by any who wish ιο understand Horace.

There iano connexion between the two odes, except that the title, which belongs to this,

has been horrowed for the other, and there is no reasonto suppose that Horace, waiting

at his farm, had any other than an imaginary Tyndaris, with an imaginary Cyrus, iu
his mind.
ARGUMENT.

Tyndaris, often doth Pan leave Lycaeus ιο visit Lucretilis, protecting my flocks from
sun and wind ; my goats go urrharmed and sear not snake or wolf when his sweet
pipo sounds in the vale oi' Ustica. The gods love mc for my piety and my muse.
Hera Plenty awaits thee3 here shalt thou retine from the hest and sing of the loves

· of Penelope and Circo sor Ulysses. Here thou shaIt quati mild Lesbios in tho shade,

nor shall strifc he mingied with the cup, nor shalt thou seur the jcalous Cyrus, lest he

lay his violent hand upon thee. .

Venox amoenum saepe Lucretilem
Mutat Lycaeo Faunus et igneam

Defendit aestatem capellis
Usque meis pluviosque ventae.
Impune tutum per nemus arbutos
Quaerunt latentes et thyma deviae
Olentis uxores mariti,
Nec virides metuunt colubras
