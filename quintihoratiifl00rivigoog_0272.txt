236 HORd'lII FLACCI

commend. Ido nothnow why one should go into this end suchdihe minute points
except as it helpo ns to truce the progress of Horace’s mind end style, which it is
plain went through ι great change alter the publication oi the three first books of the
odes. 1 very much doubt whether he could heve copied himself ιο exuctly ss he has
done in those two odes if any great interval hsd elspsed between them. I therefore arn
inclined to set down this among Horace's carhet odes which he brought out of his desh
for the purpose above mentioned. But others will have their own opinion, und 1 sm
not wedded to mino. It will ιι any rate be observed that the introduction ol Τοι-
qustus' name or the omission of it would 'be equelly immaterisl to the character und
scope ol the ode, and thut what hes been said ol other odes, und among them that
above referred ιο, is equally applicable ιο ιιι, hemely, ιιιι the neme ol a ffimd is

ARGUMENT.

The winter is gone und the spring is retur-ning with its green leaves, its gautlet
ιιιιιιιιι, and its tiraces. The reasons change end remind ιιι oi our end: bnt ιιι
revolving year'repairs its losses, while we go ιο ιιι dust for ever, and ιιι kuow not
when it will be. what thou dost enjoy thysellis so much tehen from thy greedy
heir. When thou art deod, Torquatus, thy family, thine eloquenca end thy piety
will not restore thee ιο life any more than tho love of Diana could bring back
Hippolytus or the hieudship of Theseus Peirithous.

Drrroonnu nives, redeunt jam gramina campis
Arboribusque comae3

Mutat terra vices ct decrescentia ripas
Flumina proetereunt3

Gratia cum Nymphis geminisque sororibus audet
Ducere nuda choros.

Immortalis ne speres monet annus ct ulmum
Quae rapit hora diem.

Frigora mitescunt Zephyrio, ver proterit aestas
Interitura simul ιο

Pomiier Auctumnus fruges effirderit, et mox
Bruma recurrit iners.

Damna tamen celeres reparant coelestia lunae:
Nos ubi decidimus

Quo pius Aeneas quo dives 'lidius et Ancus ιι
Pulvis et umbra sumus.
