CARMINUM IV. 7. 235

Reddidi carmen docilis modorum

eloquence (v. 2³), that person was bury in making money, and so was this. But who
this Torquatus was wa have no menna of deciding. lintre (Prorop. Hor. p. 497) sug·
gesta that it may have been Aulus Torquatus, mentioned by Nepos in his life of Atticus
(c. 11) aa haring been with the army oi Brutus and eonius at Philippi. This would
gire him an acquaintance with Horace, which may have ripened into friendship. In

likeness to O. ts (which, it may he observod, was nominaily addresaed to one oi
Horaee’s compauiona at Phihppi, and therefore, if Eatrt's conjecture isright, to a
friend of Torquatna); and supposing it to have been written, which 1 think notat all

probably tor the purpose oi making up a fascienlus to publhh according to Angustus
