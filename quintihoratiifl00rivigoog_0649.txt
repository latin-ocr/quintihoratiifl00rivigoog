EPISTOLARUM I. 13.

Si validus, si laetus erit, si denique poscet ς

Ne studio nostri pecces odiumque libellis ⁸
Sedulus importes opera vehemente minister.

Si te sorte meae gravis uret sarcina chartae,
Abjicito potiusquam quo perferre juberis
Clitellas ferus impingas, Asinaeque paternum
Cognomen vertas in risum et fabula iias.
Viribus uteris per clivos, flumina, lamas3
Victor propositi simul ac perveneris illuc,

Sic positum servabis onus, ne forte sub ala
Fasciculum portes librorum ut rusticus agnum,
Ut vinosa glomus furtivae Pyrrhia lanae,
