humour with himself when be wrote it. He describes himself as suffering less from
bodily than mental weairness, irritability, sluggishneas, pervemeness, and caprice. He
may use rather stronger language thau was necessary, hut there can he no doubt he
felt agood deal of what he says that he felt. lt shows that a meu may gire good adriae

were written in an unhind spirit towards celsus, which 1 do not understand. 'lhe
counsel in the last verse does not imply this. It is advice such aa a young man lstely
promoted to an important office might be glad of; and if the manner seems abrupt to
us, it was nothing at that time probably between friends of whom one was young
