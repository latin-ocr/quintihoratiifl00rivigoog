SATIRARUM 1. 10.

SATIRE X.

The linc oi selideience Horace took in the fourth Setire (see Introduction, end
v. 6ιι.), led him into u criticism of Lucilius, which gere ehesh handle tc his adverse·
ries, who proiessed an admiration ior thet poet, bnt admired him for his worse fenlts of
teste, und especially for his combination oi Greek words with his mother tongue-ss
prectice the ellectution oi which uo oue would more instinctively feel und condemn then
Horace. The occasion did not give scope for much good writing, und the Sutire hee
little merit ss e composition. Somebody wishing to try his skill in imiteting Horace,
prefixed tc this poem the following verses, which ure generally, though not universnlly,
allowed to be spurious, but they eppeer in some good MSS. qulre (F. H. p. 107) seys
they are genuine. They ere discnssed in en Excnmus by Orelli, end ‘un s paper by
Jeeobs (Lect. Vsu. xi.) :-

“ Lucili, quem sis mendosus, teste Getone
Defensore tuo, pervincum, qni mule suetos
Emendare purut versus ς hoc lenius ille
Est quo vir melior, louge subtilior illo,
Qui multum puer et loris et funibus udis
Exhortntus, nt esset opem qui ferre postis
Antiquis posset contre fastidio nostre,
Grammaticorum equitum doctissimus. Ut redeam illue ;''

WelLI said thet Lucillns' verses were rough And who cen dcny iti’ But I gere ·

enough to ruise s lungh, though thet hus its merit3 there should be terseness und
variety, goingfrom groseto guy, irem the severe emtor orthe lucen sutirist to the
polished wit. A mixture of humour und severity is the wey to settle gsnve questions.

“ Oh! but Lucilius was grem iu the blending oi Greek words with our own.'' Bloclr·

And while our great advocates ure working ont their speeuhes with much lsbour in

my strength lies in thet style in which Verre und others have fuiled, though 1 sm
