(v. 187). ‘Why refusa burial to the great Ajax, 0 king ι’ ‘Because hc was ao mad ae
to klll a llock of sheep and thought hc was killing Ulysses, Menelaus, and me! ‘But
were you sane when yon offered your child at Aulis? Ajax spared his own llesb and
blood; and, though he curaed the Atridae, he did not kill either Teucer or even
Ulysses.' ‘But to loose the lieet Ι propitiated the gods with blood! ‘Yes, madrmn,
with your own.’—Any man who takes up false fancies is out of hie mind, whether it
be hom folly or passion. kjax was mad; but when you commit crimes for the sake
of empty titles‚ are you not es mad as he? 1f a man were to carry about alamb
and call it his daughter, he would be treated as a lunatio. If on the other hand
hc were to take his daughter for a lamb aud sacrifice her, he would be called mad
too. 'rhefool theu is med, thedepraved ismore med, but the ambitiousis maddest
of all.

(v. 224) “Thon for the spendtbrilt, he is certainly mad. A young man comes into
his father'e property: he sends for all the tradesmen aud llings his money at
random among them. Another takes ιι jewel from his mistress’ ear, melts it down
and swallowa it: another dines habitually on nightlngales. Are these mad or not
mad?

(v. 247). “ If we see an elderly gentleman riding on a stick, and playiug at clrildren's
gemes, we say he is mad. Is not be as mad who wbines after a harloti' And if so, is
it not better to follow Polemo's example, to listen ιο ιΙιο voice of wisdom, and to cast
away the cusigns of lust and repent? 'l'be child who refuses the huit you offer him,
and if he cannot get it longe to have it, only represents the caprices of lovers squab·
bling and making it up again. Is not the man prattling end pleylng lovers’ gamas
with his mistress as mad aa the dotard we have mentioned i to say nothing of the
bloodahed lust often leode ιο, as in the case of Marius the other day, who murdered
his mistress and destroyed himself.

(v. 281.) “'l'here was once a libertinus who went about from shrine to shrine praying
the goda to give him immortality. Α certain mother vowed if her son recovered
from his fever he should stand up to his chin in the liber. The boy reoovers, the
vowis performed, aad the fever comes back. Now what was their medaeas?-
Superstition.''

(v. 296.) Thus has Stertinius ermsd me against all the world. If. any one says 1 am
mad, I can tell him to look at home

Friend‚ success attend you. Prny tell me what is my particular msdnese. I am not
avare that 1 am otherwise thau sane.

Did Pentheus' mother think herself mad even when she carried the head of her poor

Well, 1 admitl am mad. But tell me how.

Why, you are aping Maecenas and building beyond your means, as the dwarf might ape
the giant, or ae the frog ln the foble aped the bull. 'lben you write versos. Ι say
nothing of your horrible temper-

No more of that!

—or of your living beyond your income-

Mind your own business, Damasippus

—and your thousand mad amours.
