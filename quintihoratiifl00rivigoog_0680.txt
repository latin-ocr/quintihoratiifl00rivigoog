EPISTLE XIX.

lt would appear that Horace had imitatore among those who abnsed hirnr and if r
waere to understand him 10 mean what he says, there were those who took his con·
vivial odes literslly, and, eonpling them with the example cf the old Greek poete, eon·
celred that the way 10 write verses was 10 propitiato Bocclrns and drialr 0 great (1001
01 wine. But perhaps he only means that they took 10 writing in 11000ωο strsin all
about wine and driving dull esre away, aad so forth, which 01 second hand would bc
very poor staff. Such servile imitators hc speaks ef with great disgnst ς and, while he
expones their shallowness, he accounts for· their malevolenee towards himself hythe
fact 01 his 001 having sought their company or hired their applause. He 01 110 same
