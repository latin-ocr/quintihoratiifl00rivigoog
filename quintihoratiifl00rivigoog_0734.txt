ARGUMENT.

Ridiculous se a menstrons picture, combining the hesd of a woman with a body mede
up ef beust, iowl‚ eud iish, is that poem of which the images ere thrown together like
asiclr msu’s dream, whose beginning and end heve no connexion.

But pects end painters may take what liberties they plesse.

Granted, within bounds; but not thet they should breed monsters, or petch ep their
verses with tswdry irreges, ont of pisce, like the psinter who stuclr a cypress iu
his picture oi a wrech. In short, vehatever it is, let it be simple sud uniform.

(v. 24.) We poets are apt to be rnieled by some standard of our own. A men tries to
be short and becomes obscure ; ιο ιο smooth and becomes vspid; ιο ιο sublime and
becomes turgid; ιο ιο humhle end becomes creeping; ιο ιο r'aried and produces
rnonsters. So in avoiding ene error skill is needed lest we fall into the opposite.

(v. 32.) Nelther would 1 ιο ss thet artist who could finish better than any one the
surell details oi a statue, but could not compone a whole. Cboose your subject
according ιο your strength. Se shall you liud words end method, the merit of which
is thet it seyr every thing et the right-time, eud chooses its topice with judgment.

(v. 46.) In the choice and introduction οι words also ears is required, so thet old words
may get new force from their connexion. You mey use new words if necessary,
provided you de not erceed, especially if theybe taken from the Greek. Why should
not we do it as well es the poete ef old? Words drop in time lilre the leevfl of the
forest: ell things must perish3 tho greatest worls of skill must decsy, how much
more must langusge? But old words will rise up egein if fsshiou wille, ior she is
the mistress of speech.

(r. 73.) In the relationes martial deede Homer led tho way. Thon elegy came with
lamentation aud with love, the author of which our critice heve not determined.
Archilocus was driven by rege to iambics, which the stage adopted. To the lyre they
sang of gods aud hereseos lighters and hersen, of love and wine.

(v. 86.) Now ii Ι cannot maintain the distinctions of style, how cen 1 ιο celled ο poeti
Why should 1 not rather leam? Comedy is not to be expressed in trsgic style, nor
tragedy in cenric, though cemedy may sometimes raise ber tone sud tregedy lower
hers. A poem mast be not only feir to loolr at, but sweet and effecting‚ und mast
striks the chord of sympathy. And the language must be suited ιο ιιο character.
Fer there is thet in our nature which adepte itsclf ιο every variety οἰ circumstance,
according ee the tongue sets it before ns. But if the langusge sud character do not
agree. it only creates a leugh.

(v. 119.) 'I'hen egeln yon must either follow tredition or let your fictione be consistent.
Achilles must be tho impetuose stern warrior, Medea the ravage mother, end re on.
Or if you venture on bringing forward e new character it must be consistent
throughout.

(v. 128.) It is not easy te hendle subjecte which all may handle. One may more easily
dramatize the fell oi Troy than write a new story entirely. But e man may make
common property his own if he does not conduc himself to ordinary common-places.
or follow his suthor too literully and tie himself down ιοο much. And you must not
begin ostentatiously‚ or the issue will be only ridiculons, like thet of the mountain in
lsbour. Ilow simple is Homer's beginning, “Tell otthonem, 0 Muse,’' dcc. 'l'hcre
is ne smolre here coming atter the dash, but the light grows upon ue as we prmed
iu the shapo oi beautiful and marvellous tales: he carries ue on rapidly to the ead,
