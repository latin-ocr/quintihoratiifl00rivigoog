EPISTLE XIII.

This letter professes ιο ιο written by Horsce ιο one Vinius, the bearcr of οοιιιιιι
volnruescf his ιο Augentus st Rome, Horace being probably et his own estete. lle
writes as if he hod given his friend particular nnd anxious instructions ιιιιοιι ιο united
ris ιο ιιι behaviour, sud ss if this wss ιο ιο sent alter him to overtske him ou the rond,

in order ιο impress tiro instructions upon liis memory. It is probuble thet some such
jokcs mny heve pessed between Horace end his messenger when he sterted sud thet he

amused himself estcrwsrds by putting them intothc form of thisEpistle, which it is not i

unlikely he showed Augustus ; but more Ι think is mode of it iu this respect ιιιιιι ιι
will beer, as if it were written for theespecinl purpose of commending tc Augustus the
rnodesty of the writer, und apologiziug for the intrusicn, end sc forth. lmnnot see
sny such design. The person is assumed ιο ιο ignorent of the world, end therefore
lieble io make mistekes in tho execution of his missione to intrude at sn uusmsonsble
time3 in the eugenuess of his sii'ection for Herses tc be ιοο officious ς ιο csrry the books
nwkwsrdly, so es to drew attention, οι ιο stop in the streete ιιι order to tell his curicus
friends what important business ιιο was upon. 'l'he person addressed is cslled Vinius,
end the allusion in v. 8 lesds ιο ιιιο infercuce that his cognomen wes Asellus, or Asine,
orAsella. Asellus wss s cognomen of the Annis, Claudio, and Cornelis genta. Αειιιι
also wss of tho Cornelis. Porphyrion cells the man Vinnius Asella, while the other
Scholiasts cell him Caninius (which may be sn error ior Ceius) Vinnius Fronto. 'l'hers
wss one T. Vinius Philopoemen proscribcd hythe triumviis for concealing his patru-
nus, whose neme therefore mis the suine, end the Vinio gens was in existence ιι this
time. It hes been conjectured by Decier, snd believed by others, thet the person here
eddrcssed wasone ofthe lire tenants mentioned in the ιιοιι Iipistle, r. 3. The eon·
jecture may be taken for wlret itis worth. No one cen deny thet he muy hare been
one of those persons. Ηο wss ιιοι, ιι Orelli seyen ‘tubellsrius' or letter cerrier, ss his

l

name sufficiently shows, for s ‘tabellarius’ wesa clere, yet seme hsce treated him ιι ,

such.

What the volumus were that Horsce wss sending to Aegeum it is impossible te say,
but they msy heve contained the flrst three books of tlrc Odes, end, if rc, the Epiale
wes probably written in suo. 780. Frsnke thinks so very decidedly ι bnt ull dc net
adopt thst date, snd some suppose the Satires ιο ιο the ‘volumius' referred ιο.
