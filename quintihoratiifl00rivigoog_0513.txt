SATIRARUM II, 3.

Ferre sinn laxo, donare et ludere vidi,

Te, Tiberi, numerare, cavis abscondere tristem,
Extimui ne vos ageret vesania discors,

Quare per divos oratus uterque Penates,

Τιι cave ne minuas, tu ne majus facias id

Quod satis esse putat pateret natura co'e'rcet.
Praeterea ne vos titillet gloria jure

Jurando obstringam ambo: uter sedilis fueritve 100
Vestrum praetor, is intestabilis et sacer esto.
