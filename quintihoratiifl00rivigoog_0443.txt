SATIRARUM Ι. 7. 407

where the scene must have been unknown or little known ς when most of those who
might have enjoyed the joke were dead or in exile, and his own feeling against Rupilius
must have been forgotten in the soenes that he had since gone through. The poem is
a mere saginent in the dramatis style so admirably austained in the ninth satire; but
in this there is no character brought out, noue of tha happy teuchos und truite of nature
which there ara found in every line. Certainly no two poema could baar lass evidence
of being the work of the same mind, und this may be taken us some indication of the
early compositiones the present Satira ; but Ι rest mora on tho circumstance that the
point of the story would have been lost in a great measme any length of timo alter the
event it refers to. Perhaps wa may infer from the abruptness of the conclusion that
Horace intended when he begua to make a longer poem, but found his materiale or hia
time or his spirit fail.

Pnoscmerl Regis Rupili pus etque venenum
Hybrida quo paeto'sit Persius ultus, opinor
Omnibus et lippis notum et tonsoribus esse.
Persius hic permagna negotia dives habebat -
Clazomenis, etiem lites cum Rege molestas,
Durus homo atque odio qui posset vincere Regem,
Confidens tumidusque, adeo sermonis amari
Sisennae Barros ut equis praecurreret albis.
