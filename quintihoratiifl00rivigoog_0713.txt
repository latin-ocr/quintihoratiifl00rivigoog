Choerilus, incultis qui versibus et male natis

Rettulit acceptos, regale nomisma, Philippos.

Sed veluti tractata notam labemque remittunt 235
Atramenta, fere scriptores carmine foedo

Splendida facta linunt. Idem rex ille poema

Qui tam ridiculum tam care prodigus emit,

Edicto vetuit ne quis se praeter Apellen

Pingeret‚ aut alius Lysippo duceret aera

Fortis Alexandri vultum simulantia. Quodsi

J udicium subtile videndis artibus illud

Ad libros et ad haec Musarum dona vocares,
Boeotum in crasso jurares atre natum.
