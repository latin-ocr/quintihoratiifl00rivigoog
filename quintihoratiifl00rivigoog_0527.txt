SATIRARUM II. 4. 491

de ee ipso, Haec primus inuenit ct cognovit Catius Miltiades.” Hedoes not wem how·
ever ιο have observed that Catius ie only representing the words οι his tenebar. But
ae thie person must have been dead many years before this Satira was written (Cicero’e
letter was written auo. 709), it bae been supposed by some that Horrace introduces hie
name, though he was no longer living, only aa a handle t'or ridiculing the Epicureane.
Orelli suggests that Horaee’e Catina was a freedman of Cieero’e Catius, end a oon·
temptible person, notorious ae a writer on ceolrery. Certainly a well-known name
would anrwer every purpose even if the owner were dead, and the former οι these two
opinions is probably correct.

Tbat Horace chose aweit-known Epicurean as the speaker in thie gastrunomical
Satira, seems to show that he no longer held with that sect when he wrote it (C. i. 343
S. ι. 5.101). That the iollowers of Epicurus went beyond their master in commending
sensual delights may very well be believed. Ῑι ιι usually thalete oi uneound teachere,
that their errore are exaggerated by those who profess ιο adopt them. It appears that
Epicurus held πολνιελῆ cirea to be only mcoudary pleusures, οὐκ ἀναγκαίου that he
held a man should be able to do without them, though if he could afford thern he would
do well to have them3 and indeed that he had a good opinion even of tasting (Diog.
Laert. x. lav—149). But hie Roman adherente did not take that view of their duty,
and under the sanction οι hie name and school made good living the chief good, end the
art of cookery the art oi lile (see Introduction to S. 2 of this book).
