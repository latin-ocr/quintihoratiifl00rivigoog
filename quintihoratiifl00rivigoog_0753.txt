Et tulit eloquium insolitum facundia praeceps, -

Utiliumque sagax rerum et divina futuri

Sortilegis non discrepuit sententia Delphis.

Carmine qui tragico vilem certavit cb hircum, sao
Mox etism agrestes Satyros nudavit, et asper

Incolumi gravitate jocum tentavit, eo qnod

illecebris erat et grate novitate morandus

Spectator, functusque sacris et potus et exlex.

Verum ita risores, ita commendare dicaces

Conveniet Satyros, ita vertere seria lude,

Ne quicunque deus, quicunque adhibebitur heros,

Regali conspectus in auro nuper et ostro,

Migret in obscuras humili sermone tabernas,

Ant dum vitat humum nubes et inania captet. aee
