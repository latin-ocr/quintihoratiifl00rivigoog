PREFACE. xiii

Biturs Commentary, and I have got good matter from it. Ritter
isa sharp critic and u learned mcu,¹who has done something for
the explanation of Horace, and I acknowledge my obligations to
him. Itis his business to excuse himself, if he cen, for writing
some absurd notes aud proposing some interpretatione which no
sensible man will accept.

I have also used for the Satires and Epistles Kriiger's school
edition, with German notes. Itis a very useful book. 'Phe notes
prove that the editor hss good judgment, and what we in this
country cell souud common sense, in which many learned editors
are very deficient.

Ihnve not touched Mr. Maclecue’s arguments and introductione,
except in very few cases3 nor have I added any thing on the chro-
nolcgy of the poems, except a, little here and there. Mr. Macleane
has done this very well. He judiciously abstained from fixing
dates where there is uo evidence, unlike many critice who have
sometimes fixed them without evidence and sometimes contrary to
evidence. Indeed, most commentators have very imperfect concep-
tione cf the nature of proof; end it would be a great improvement
if they could be taught in some way not to coufound hypotheses
and guesses with probable conclusione sud demonstratiou.

1 shall here put a question which some people may think nune·
cessary 3 but I do not think so. When a man has been used to
read a book at intervals for half u century, he may reasonably ask
himself whether he has been wasting his time, end whether other
persons may not do the same. There ere only few books worth
reading often cr much, but Horace isone of them. He lived with
some of the chief men of an age when the Roman polity was chang-
ing into a form which has had n lastiug influence on Europe, and
through Europe on the rest of the world3 and his writiugs have
made ns familiar with the mun himself, with the times in which he
lived, the character of his contemporaries, end the manners cf the
day. Horace’s good sense makes his Satires and Epistles almost as
intelligible aad as instnrctive ns if they were written now; for the
best part cf them is independent of the allmions to things sud per·
sons, and many of the allusione are not more obscure than similar
