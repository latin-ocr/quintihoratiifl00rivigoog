Q. HORATII FLACCI

OARMINUM

LIBER QUARTUS.

' OARMEN I.

nnc. 739.

In is clear that Horace, aster the publication of the lirat three bools oi hia odes, laid
asida that style, or wrote in it only occasionally. Sc far aa bis lyrical compositions ex·
preaaed, ir in hia case they aver did, any real passion, growing years and bodily intlrmity
would naturally turn him from writing odes. So far aa his poema were mere imitatione
οἰ the Greek, we can understand hia getting tired oi that style as he grew older, and
turning to tba more original end serione teslr which employed him in the Epistlea Of
the ligbter sort, therefore, we lind bnt few in this book, and those probably inserted to

mkeupaaufficicntvolume. But his sereret style he had not loat, and noneof hia Ι

earlier compositione snrpass the moral and bistoriml odes of this boolr. Why he should
hare written the first it is not easy to say. lt was composed apparently ‘invita Minerva,’
and except the smoothnees ol its rhythm it has little to commend it. Nobody will read
it and believe that tho man was in love who wrote it, still lesa that he was influenced by
a drivelling affection ior the boy Ligurinas mentioned at the end, and in Ο. 10 of thia
book. Perhaps he found a Greek ode that took his fancy and imitated it, and then
publishcd it to flll his book, not aa a prologue to it, as many oi the chronologists say,-
for what is there in the ode that bears that characteri 'lhe sirth verae says it was
written when he was about noy (circa lustra decem), which age he attained on the eth
Dece-ber, ano. 739. A fragment ol Alcman (20 Bergk)—

(ρον με δ’ αὖτε Κύπριδος ἕκατι
γλυκὺς κατοῐβον καρδίαν ἰαίνει-

- seems to be part oi an odo which this of Horace might be imitated from. So lilrewiae
one of Ibycus (2 Bergk)-

κηλήμασι παντοδαποῖς ds ἄπειρα δίκτυα Κύπριδι βάλλει·

ᾗ μὰν τρομέω νιν ἐπερχομέναν, καλ.

l do not asweiatc the ode with (l. iii. 26 for the reasons there stated. But there is so
mnch resemblance between thia and C. i. 19 aa to confirm me ln the opinion that they
are both imitationa.

Art thou at war with me again, Venus? spara me, for 1 am old. Go to the young. Go
to Paullus, for he ia noble, handaorne, elever. (live him the victory, and he will give
thee in return a marble statne in uati-inc of citron‚ with incense, music, and dancing
